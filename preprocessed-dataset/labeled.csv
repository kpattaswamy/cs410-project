# The Game

Everyone begins the year with **$100,000**. You may divide that any way you like. You may choose to keep some or all of your money as cash for a period. The game is open as soon as I post this.

I did a terrible job making time to write this so any questions or comments you have are welcome.

## Post Format

After this first cycle, I will not manually fix trades for you. Posts will be parsed by a very simple regular expression that's looking for posts that look exactly like this:

	- !buy MSFT: 236
	- !buy AAPL: 999
	- !buy BRK.A: 1
	- !buy MEME: 1

...which will look like this list when Reddit parses the Markdown:

 - !buy MSFT: 236
 - !buy AAPL: 999
 - !buy BRK.A: 1
 - !buy MEME: 1

We loop through and execute sells first and move from the top of the list to the bottom so this example would buy up to 236 shares of $MSFT and up to 999 in $AAPL. Robinhood does not support partial shares and you don't have that much money so the attempt would result in...

 - 236 shares of $MSFT @ 85.48/share
 - 472 shares of $AAPL @ 169.10/share	
 - zero shares of $BRK.A because you don't have that much cash left over
 - zero shares of $MEME because it's fake
 - $11.52 left over in cash
	
That's a poor example because I'm headed out right now but this is the math the bot will do. (prices are last execution based on post timestamp or post edit timestamp.)

To sell shares, you'd add a line like this:

	- !sell MSFT: 3000
	
And you'll sell up to 300 shares of $MSFT. I'll clarify this tonight. I really gotta go now.

## Supported Instruments

Only instruments supported by Robinhood are allowed to be used in this game. That means no weird OTC stocks or something you heard about in Canada or warrants. If you cannot buy it on Robinhood, you won't be able to buy it here. When options are open for more/most to apply, I'll need time to sort out if and how that would work for our silly little game.

## Corporate Actions

If a company you 'invested' in goes belly up, merges, changes symbol, goes OTC, or has some other major change, you will need to make me aware of it (msg the bot). Otherwise, the position will likely be liquidated.

## Trades

We will not have to worry about this now, but when trades are made, the bot will handle order lots in FIFO. I'm seriously late leaving today. Sorry!

## The Schedule

The 12 monthly trading cycles cover the first five trading days of every month. For example, January 2nd is the first trading day this month so you have until the 8th to make any trades. You may change/update your trades all the way until close on the 5th trading day. **Posts should be edited rather than deleted.**

## Data

Trades will be 'executed' using historical data from Robinhood. For our example above, this would be the URL scraped for data: https://api.robinhood.com/quotes/historicals/?symbols=MSFT,AAPL,BRK.A,MEME&amp;interval=5minute&amp;bounds=trading This allows for prices during extended trading to count and allows us to narrow down prices to the nearest 5min interval. Buys will use the low_price and sells/liquidations will use the high_price.",-1

7ngkcl,1514830524,mcd,Is Evo Kucherov essentially Evo McDavid with a better shot?,"I absolutely love McDavid's Evo but I compared him to Kuch on HUTDB and it looks like Kucherov is nearly the same but with a considerably better shot. Do you still notice a difference in speed when comparing him to McDavid? One of my favorite attributes of McD is how he can blow by nearly anyone on defense.

Here is how they compare on HUTDB. I noticed 98 speed vs 99 speed between the two cards being really the only difference (minus endurance) in their skating categories:

7nhc2r,1514838093,aapl,Hesitant to invest in $AAPL,"Looking at AAPLs fundamentals and the pile of cash they are about to be sitting on due to the tax bill makes me think AAPL might be a good investment moving forward. The valuation is also excellent relative to other popular companies. Here's why I don't want to put my money in just yet.

The biggest risk I see is that 70% of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone sales. I think iPhones are great, in fact I'm typing this on my iPhone right now. The iPhone X is too expensive and there has been bad publicity surrounding iPhone batteries lately which could eat into their sales numbers. Selling at over $1000 is a deal breaker for me and I would strongly consider taking my business to Samsung if it was time for a new phone. I can only imagine other consumers must feel the same way.

Additionally, part of the reason the company is so profitable is because the profit margins on iPhones are huge at about 60%. Apple is clearly a master of marketing and maintaining a strong customer base. I worry that the next time there's an economic downturn, no one is going to be able to afford these luxury products and Apple will have to drastically lower its profit margins in order to stay competitive. Additionally, there may be new, cheap smartphones which may not be as powerful as an iPhone, but gets the job done. I'm thinking like how an amazon fire 7 for $50 is expected to compete with the Apple iPad for $300+. 

Lastly and least importantly, looking at the max history of the AAPL stock price charts shows that the company tends to fall out of favor for long periods of time every few years. I don't know much about technical analysis, but based on recent news it seems like the company could be at a turning point once again. 

I really do want to invest in this company based on the amount of cash they'll be sitting on for reinvestment, the amount of cash that continues pouring in, and the strength of the brand name, but for these reasons I feel like I shouldn't.

Here's my portfolio. It's all biotech/pharma/BABA. Once I start getting more working capital, I look to also begin to invest in some more conservative blue-chip stocks. $NVDA, $INTC, and $MSFT are all looking to have good growth this next year. 

Below is my portfolio:

* $BPMX -- 33%. Riding pretty heavy and feel pretty confident in this 
* $IGC -- 7.5%. Seeing pretty good returns from this so-far. I'm curious to see how CA effects the weed stock market in general.
* $XXII  -- 15%. They're the only company to have IP in and succesfully modulate nicotine levels. With FDAs recent discussion on nic modulation in 2019, there's promise here
* $CDXS -- 5.5%. Sales growth has consistently been positive, and has been pretty stable. I expect &gt;7% return
* $BABA -- 34%. China's Amazon. This is picking up a lot of US attention, and not to mention the growth of China's middle-class. I'm holding long on this one.
* $LTEA -- 5%. Recent blockchain anouncement and volatility really made me interested in this. This is just a fun pick :)

* $BABA -- 34%. China's Amazon. This is picking up a lot of US attention, and not to mention the growth of China's middle-class. I'm holding long on this one.
* $LTEA -- 5%. Recent blockchain anouncement and volatility really made me interested in this. This is just a fun pick :)

What are your guys thoughts? I'd be interested to see what penny stocks you guys are looking at in the beginning of this year.

Edit: today went great. :)",-1
7ni0o7,1514844721,aapl,ETF advice please!,"I’ve decided I’m most likely interested in just ETF investing.  I’m confident in 6-8% YOY gains and the security that brings long run.

Right now I own (this is my investment outside of 401k and Roth IRA, also.. I decided I wanted more money in market so this does not represent any retirement money)

VTI - 13.35
VOO - 23.8
VWO - 11.93
MGK - 11.9
AAPL - 21.9

I want to sell Apple, consolidate VTI into VOO and decide how to work with VOO, VWO and MGK.  Does MGK make sense?  What other ETFs should I be looking into to continue to diversify?

Edit: those are percentages ",-1
7ni2nx,1514845268,msft,My Stock Estimates for 2020,"Today is 1-1-2018.

These are my calls for 1-1-2020. Many of these stocks, whether I predict them to be huge gainers or huge losers, have my attention for these two years.

This is my unprofessional, dumb, beginner attempt to guess what the stock market will be in 2 years if we have a bear market between now and then and if we have a bull market between now and then.

I am not at all predicting this to be accurate. I'm writing this down as a means of reference to see how close or far I was when 1-1-2020 comes.

These are my calls for 1-1-2020. Many of these stocks, whether I predict them to be huge gainers or huge losers, have my attention for these two years.

This is my unprofessional, dumb, beginner attempt to guess what the stock market will be in 2 years if we have a bear market between now and then and if we have a bull market between now and then.

I am not at all predicting this to be accurate. I'm writing this down as a means of reference to see how close or far I was when 1-1-2020 comes.

7nmgw3,1514900450,msft,Thinking about investing and using margin but I have questions!,"So I have dabbled in stock trading off and on but have been out of it for years, anyway, every year for the last several years I kept telling myself that no way the market will keep going higher and a crash will happen, well I've been wrong and the market has just gone up!

So I decided now is the time, especially with tax reform set to boost stocks and I'm finally ready to invest. So here are my questions..

I'm going to invest $5,250.00, BUT I'm thinking about using margin so I can invest $10,500. 

The interest rate on the margin loan is 8.5% which is $446.00 per year, the dividends paid out from the stocks I want are $490.00 per year.

Can I just use dividends to pay the interest on the margin loan?

Also, is margin a good idea? It seems like if investors used margin the last decade they would have made a ton of money!

Also, I'm wanting to invest long term and as long as the dividends keep paying the margin interest, I can use margin to hold stocks long term Right?

Fyi, I'm going to be smart and invest in good, great tech companies. I'm looking to take positions in INTC, AAPL, FB, AMZN and MSFT using margin.

7nmm8y,1514902230,nvda,WEEKLY OUTLOOK,"**WEEKLY OUTLOOK**

When markets reopen after the holidays today, all eyes  will be on the monthly U.S. employment report, coming on Friday. On Wednesday, we will hear of the FED’s December policy meeting with further clues on the future of monetary policy. Chinese manufacturing datas will give fresh indications on the health of the world's second biggest economy. Eurozone inflation data comes on Friday, and in the UK manufacturing, construction and service concerns are in focus, thanks to the Brexit’s effect on the economy.





**CASINOS FINISH STRONG**

Gaming revenue in Macau rose for the first time in three years in 2017 as appetite for gambling recovers following a protracted government campaign against public shows of wealth by officials and slowing economic growth. MGM, Las Vegas Sand, Galaxy, Wynn, and Melco are all in the pot to cook with, you gotta pick the perfect for you. Keep looking at Japanese licensing.





**THE LAST SESSION - 2018**

The end of Friday’s trading was certainly interesting as the last 30 minutes of the trading day incurred most of the day's half of a percent loss. Although the first day of January is simply another day on the calendar, much is made of the fact-, it is January and a new year. So, what is to be expected from the equity market in 2018? Who knows? But there is a significant fact! Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves. Don’t be ridiculous! Ask!





**#DAILY PICK**
**Dow Jones (DJ:DJI)** has been awesome! Why would it change? Long term only!

**Verizon (NYSE:VZ)** is in the class change, one of S&amp;P500’s last telecoms. Predictions are high.

**AT&amp;T’s (NYSE:T)** FirstNet is approved in all states! Time to make money.

**Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)** looks bulletproof, buying the deeps could pay off!

**ActiVision (NASDAQ:ATVI)** Call of Duty picked as the best game of 2017. It’s the 9th year in a row. Doubts? Shouldn’t have.





**FX WORLD**

Looking at the first session of 2018, we have to see, the exchange market is still going to be a little quiet. Momentum trades are preferable these days.

The **EURUSD** looks very strong. Considering multiple things to pay attention to, one is the look at the D1 head-shoulder form, which sends us several candles higher, and there is a very bullish trend on W1. If we move above 1.21, we will see higher levels in mid-term.

The **GBPUSD** is still supported by 1.3333 and the underlying uptrend line. It could break above 1.365, but until that, the pair will bounce back and forth between these levels. Momentum trading is preferable.

The **USDJPY** closed the year with a negative candle. 112 is supportive. If we break 113, the pair will find 114.5 first, than it will move much higher. The market could be a bit quiet till job datas will come.

7nmu8a,1514904636,aapl,"There is a 40% chance Apple will acquire Netflix, according to Citi","Is this good, is it bad, is it meh?  I'm just not sure.

On one hand I see this as potentially ruining Netflix, on the other Apple does some good things so this could be a net positive.  I do have an iPhone which I like, but don't like some of the changes Apple is making.  I've had Netflix for years, but don't like some of their choices or direction.  Just don't know.  

edit: DOH, forgot to include links

Here is a contrary note.  They seem to think this is just Citi analyst hot air, which it could well be.

7nrt3y,1514949176,tsla,Help with the Django Cache Framework,"Hey everyone,

I'm wondering if someone could help me get to know the django cache framework for a (hopefully) simple task. I'm developing a [financial analysis application](https://join.lazyfa.com) and I would like to cache some portions of the first load of the page to be reused in other sections of the app. Here's the example I'm trying to figure out right now: 

When a user sends a ticker through (e.g. AAPL) this is [the dashboard that pops up](https://imgur.com/GOWqPig). Some parts of that dashboard are done in the dashboard view. Others (for example company SIC, short %, float, profile, etc) are pulled from external sources via ajax calls and a few others (e.g. calculations like burn rate, averages, etc) are populated dynamically by making ajax calls to other views. 

That part all works fine. The dashboard loads in a couple seconds and whatever doesn't load gets pulled in via AJAX as the user uses what's available.

Now when a user switches to the red flags &gt; income statement section, I'd like to keep the entire company summary section (Overview, Company Information, Recent News) in cache so it doesn't have to be retrieved again. So in the dashboard view, after doing all the biz logic to return the context used in the ajax calls, I just set a cache key ('context') to the context and store it for some amount of time. For example, just storing it for 60 seconds:

    # Do stuff to set all these dicts and stuff that's used on the dashboard, then...

    template = 'dashboard.html'
    context = {
        'ticker': ticker,
        'companyInfo' : companyInfo,
        'database' : database,
        'annual_dict_most_recent' : annual_dict_most_recent,
        'quarterly_dict_most_recent' : quarterly_dict_most_recent,
        'ttm_dict_most_recent' : ttm_dict_most_recent,
        'annual_dict_most_recent' : annual_dict_most_recent,
        'quarterly_dict_most_recent' : quarterly_dict_most_recent,
        'ttm_dict_most_recent' : ttm_dict_most_recent,
        'INCOME_COLLECTION' : INCOME_COLLECTION,
        'BALANCE_COLLECTION' : BALANCE_COLLECTION,
        'CASHFLOW_COLLECTION' : CASHFLOW_COLLECTION,
        'METRICS_COLLECTION' : METRICS_COLLECTION,
        'INCOME_Q_COLLECTION' : INCOME_Q_COLLECTION,
        'BALANCE_Q_COLLECTION' : BALANCE_Q_COLLECTION,
        'CASHFLOW_Q_COLLECTION' : CASHFLOW_Q_COLLECTION,
        'METRICS_Q_COLLECTION' : METRICS_Q_COLLECTION,
        'jsonTickerList' : jsonTickerList,
    }
    cache.set('context', context, 60)
    
    return render(request, template, context)

Then when a user clicks the income statement link, I can do this in the relevant view: 

    context = cache.get('context')
    template = 'income.html'
    return render(request, template, context)

That works perfectly and loads the whole company summary section from cache, but there's a slight problem: If a user searches for a ticker, then opens a new tab and searches for a new ticker (e.g. TSLA), the cache is overwritten because of the new dashboard load, so if they go back to their previous tab with the dashboard for AAPL on it, when they click the income statement link it will load the company summary for TSLA. 

I understand why this is happening but I'm just not sure how to handle it cause I don't fully understand the capabilities of the caching framework or what the best way to handle this would be. 

Could someone more familiar shed a bit of light on this for me? Thanks so much!

* 7 ETFs 
* 3  Index funds
* 3 individual stocks/currencies/whatever else

As far as the ETFs goes, i'm looking at Technology(FTEC &amp; XNTK), Health(FHLC), Financial(XLF), Large Cap(SCHX), Small Cap(SCZ), and International(SCHF)...thats 7 right there.

With index funds, i'm just gonna go with the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P(SPDR). Pretty solid choices I think.I have ITOT right now. Bought it since it covered a lot of areas and was less than $100 :P

Finally, I'm gonna pick 3 stocks...So far all i have is MSFT, and i only picked this because after a project class, it looked pretty good lol. I'm sure i'll find some other things i'm confident in.

I chose Tech, Health, and Finance for the ETFs areas cause they seem pretty stable...well not Finance really.

My goal is get as close as possible the the S&amp;P returns. I have't really thought too much about allocation. Since i'm trying to match or get close to the market, i'll prob put most of my funds in the index funds, then the Large Cap, Tech, and Health Funds. Last will go to the Financial and Small Cap...I did a project in my last semester for portfolio management that dealt with allocation, but it was pretty confusing and complicated. I might be able to use that excel sheet to make an optimal risky portfolio...whatever that means lol.

Comments or help?

I'm investing with robinhood, so my options are kinda limited. There are commodity and currency funds i can invest i think though. Not too interested in currency for a long term thing though. ",1

7nvty4,1514997905,mcd,Security camera footage... MCD player for mac?,"Hi All,

Quite a technical question - I have some files from a security camera that will provide a 'behind the scenes' look at a film that I recently shot in a supermarket. The owner gave me a DVD with a data folder full of '.s' files, which I believe would be the clips, and it also contains MCDplayer.exe.

As I'm on a mac I can't open the exe, and I can't seem to find a MCD player for mac to view these files. Strange thing is, VLC seems to recognise the .s files as having a resolution (it opens a black square in 4:3 ratio, low res) but it has no time or visual content.

My only thought is to ask a friend with a PC to try opening the files - anyone got any other ideas?

7nw7t6,1515001220,tsla,Here's how Tesla did in 2017 on their commitment to double the SC network,"In 2017, Tesla made a big deal out of expanding their charging infrastructure. Their [Q1 Shareholder letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/5801341338x0x940721/8E9FC98F-343C-4D2E-8516-491DEFB9B69B/TSLA_Q1_2017_Update_Letter.pdf) said:

&gt; In 2017, we expect to **at least double** the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally to more than 10,000 and 15,000, respectively. 

The [Q2 Letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/5801341338x0x952053/F302D22F-FC9B-41A3-9534-60D0032673CC/TSLA_Update_Letter_2017-2Q.pdf) said:

&gt;We are also continuing to expand our service capability and build out our Supercharger network to achieve our goal of **doubling the number** of connection points in 2017. 

In April 2017, a [Blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/charging-our-priority) titled ""Charging Is Our Priority"" said:

&gt;We started 2017 with over 5,000 Superchargers globally and by the end of this year, Tesla **will double that number to total more than 10,000 Superchargers and 15,000 Destination Charging connectors around the world**. In North America, we’ll increase the number of Superchargers by 150 percent, and in California alone we’ll add more than 1,000 Superchargers.

This message got lots of press.

By their own blog post, Tesla started 2017 with 5,400 SC stalls and 9,000 destination chargers, so increasing to 10,000 and 15,000 isn't really doubling, but we'll go with the 10/15 numbers. Now that the new year is here, we can see how Tesla did. Per the Tesla website, as of January 1st, 2018, Tesla has:

* 7,955 open stalls across 1,115 open Supercharger sites
* 3,180 connections in the USA across 419 sites
* 681 connections in California across 63 sites
* 14,530 Destination connections in the world across 8196 sites

Breaking down against their own promises:

* **Double Superchargers to 10,000 - Missed by 41%**
* NA Supercharger increase by 150% - NA increased by 25% in 2017 (372 sites to 494)
* CA Supercharger increase by 1,000 - end of 2017 only had 681 total in CA, much less increasing by 1,000
* Double Destination chargers to 15,000 - Missed by only 3%

Other interesting Stats:

* On October 12th, 2016, 370 sites were expected in 2017, and 608 in 2018. 104 of the 370 were opened.
* As of Jan 1, 2018, 831 sites are expected in 2018, 85 sites expected in 2019 or unknown. 413 of the 2018 sites are in the USA and 132 in China.
* Of the 1,132 new connections in the last quarter, 483 were in the USA and 104 were in China
* At the beginning of Q3, the largest SC had 20 stalls. There are now 4 locations with more than 20 stalls. Tesla said ""Toward that goal, Tesla will build larger sites along our busiest travel routes that will accommodate several dozen Teslas Supercharging simultaneously.""
* The average SC has 7.4 stalls.
* 6 sites increased in number of stalls in the USA in Q3. All were in CA.
* Tesla needs to double the number of SC sites in CA to meet the 1,000 stall goal.
* There are 6 SC's in the world limited to 72 kW. 5 in the US and 1 in Canada.
* Tesla's [Q3 letter](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/5801341338x0x962149/00F6EB90-2695-44E6-8C03-7EC4E06DF840/TSLA_Update_Letter_2017-3Q.pdf) completely walked away from the doubling target and said this about charging:

&gt;We added 126 new Supercharger stations in Q3, for a total of more than 1,000 stations and over 7,000 Supercharging connectors
worldwide. Our network of destination chargers is even larger. At the end of the quarter, there were 7,200 destination charger locations
worldwide, which increased the availability of destination charging for our customers by nearly 18% in one quarter. ",0

If I exercise my option I’m basically just buying 100 shares at the strike price. But what if I want to sell my contract before the expiration date because it’s now trading at $87 and that’s good enough for me? Am I literally just trading the option itself (in the same way if trade stock with setting my limit or a stop loss and so on)? And whose buying my contract? I assume that just because I sold doesn’t mean someone is buying? And if I do sell before the expiration date, then does that date become irrelevant to me? I get the basic mechanics of what an option is, I’m just not quite sure how selling them (versus exercising them) works. ",1

7o0tpn,1515043324,tsla,Still bullish,"There's been a lot of bearish sentiment on these stocks for the past few days now, but I feel that people are missing a few things in their analysis. First and foremost, these stocks are being priced by their potential, not their actual valuations.

 When a company like Canopy lists 5.6m sq footage of potential growth capacity, it doesn't matter how much of that is lisenced or in the works. What we're seeing right now is the market trying to decide what a fair price would be for that, their sales, their oils, it goes on. But not just to July. Sure, initial financials for this summer might not be as impressive as some people think, but that's not what people are speculating on. People are thinking years down the road with this sector. Is it really crazy to be seeing some of these prices if you look at it from now-2020 or beyond? This point has been made before on here, but I think TSLA is a good comparison. People holding that stock don't care about the next quarterly, they're thinking 5-10 years from now. They're buying it on it's potential. Is TSLA on paper worth over 300 a share? No way. So, for one or more of these companies to be a potential top 5 player in an eventually fully legal north/south american and european cannabis market, what kind of price is fair to buy in for that?

 Don't get me wrong. We're due for a red day, and we could easily get it tomorrow. But I personally don't believe there's going to be a day lower than -2% for quite awhile. Could be wrong of course, but that's just my gut feeling. I think people who have been in since 2014 probably see these prices as absurd, but I think the majority of investors are starting to realize the inevitability of the legal status and the profits in this sector long term.

We continue our look at the GOP tax plans effect on companies with overseas cash. Under the bill's deemed repatriation provision, Microsoft's $132 billion in overseas cash will be taxed at 15.5%.After the $20 billion bill, we believe Microsoft will not be set for a repeat of 2004 - a $3/share special dividend - but rather incrementally increase the quarterly dividend. Now that the details of the tax plan are becoming more widely known, Microsoft will soon face investors and analysts on its upcoming earnings call, and this cash will certainly be a topic of conversation. We’ll let you know what was told.



**INTEL - MESSED-UP**

It's all over the media. It could be the biggest tech-case ever. For now, what we know for fact is, that Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold millions of dollars worth of shares after the company was informed of vulnerabilities in its semiconductors, but before it was publicly disclosed. So far it seems AMD had now information of the fraud, we don’t second guess, but will follow the story.




**BB FINALLY CATCHES A BREAK**

BlackBerry has come out of the session open up 6% after more connected-car news, with reports that its QNX will anchor the Apollo autonomous driving platform at Baidu in a key win. Baidu will integrate its own software into the QNX infotainment program as part of the collaboration.

Yes, it’s been known for a while but confirmed yesterday.

The **GBPUSD** has given up Tuesday’s gain, drew exactly the same pattern as the Euro, but at 1.35. It probably continues to go sideways, 1.365 is the ceiling and 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has gone back and forth during yesterday’s session, keeping itself above 112. Jobs datas is coming on Friday, until that don’t expect more than bouncing around. By any chance it breaks below 112, the next level is 111. Keep in mind, the better the report will be, the better the pair will do.

**FX WORLD**

FOMC meeting minutes caused basically no effect yesterday on the exchange market, we all fixated on Friday’s jobs datas.

The **EURUSD** yesterday was negative for the Euro, it fell back to 1.2 than bounced back to fill the gap from Tuesday. Looks like it continues going higher, as it recently broke out of a bullish weekly flag. Keep in mind, 1.21 is a strong resistance but if we clear it, it is a buy and hold scenario.

The **GBPUSD** has given up Tuesday’s gain, drew exactly the same pattern as the Euro, but at 1.35. It probably continues to go sideways, 1.365 is the ceiling and 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has gone back and forth during yesterday’s session, keeping itself above 112. Jobs datas is coming on Friday, until that don’t expect more than bouncing around. By any chance it breaks below 112, the next level is 111. Keep in mind, the better the report will be, the better the pair will do.

7o4fca,1515086154,nvda,Need advice on how to get out of a covered call.,"So heres my situation... 
-bought 400 shares of NVDA a couple months ago at 211.60 
-Sold calls the last couple months taking in 10.97 of premium. 
-heres where I need help. the last contracts I sold at ~3$ are now at ~$20, (showing a loss of around 6.7k).

I want to keep these shares, so what is the best way to get out of this? is my only option to roll wayyy up and out?

EDIT:ok so heres what I have decided to do.

I'm going to roll to the feb 220, which would have me virtually at break even from all my other premium. 

211.6 (share cost) - 10.97 (current amount of premium collected) +19 (cost to close these contracts) - 9 (FEB 220 call premium) = 210.60 (almost back to my original share price base). 

If it continues up through earnings in the next month and a half I get exercised at 220 / make 10 bucks a share. if it dosent continue I have my shares and have learned to never sell a covered call at a strike under my initial cost basis.

7o7wki,1515117810,mcd,[Advice needed] Two different opinion on SL and TP,"hey all! I recently just gotten started with stocks on a small scale, made some dollar in virtual/demo but without using S/L to test how this would go. It went pretty well so I read up more and decided to jump in with a small amount.

Here's the thing. I've been reading about S/L to minimise losses which some talked about roughly 5-9%, and taking profit at 20-25%. 

Thus, I opened a few trade to spread my portfolio and set the S/L accordingly. I actually had 2 buys hitting S/L in less than a week which I chucked it off as a good sign that I prevented further losses ($AXP, $SQ), only to find today, more than a week later it bounced back and doing better, or going to. But at least others are picking up well so it wasn't negative profit/loss.

Doing a bit more reading, seems like there's two sides to this sub. 

No S/L -VS- Yes S/L

I'm going for long term buys listed below so I'm thinking whether I should actually remove the S/L since flash crash could occur? No notification since market runs while I sleep, I could just have a look in the morning and decide. But since I'm betting on them long term, should I take profit at 25%? Which feels like it doesn't make sense when going long term.

An additional 31% would increase investment when prices top $66. Looking at Exxon and Chevron, XOM outperforms CVX, however the latter trades at a cheaper valuation. Presently we think that Exxon is the more favorable investment opportunity of the two companies, especially for a dividend investor.

Major Asian markets traded mostly higher with solid manufacturing data from the U.S. and China reinforcing optimism about the world economy.

Nikkei finished up to its highest levels since 1992.

Shortly after President Trump took aim at Pakistan, the nation seems ready to make an agreement with China, as the dollar would be replaced with the yuan for bilateral trade and investment.

Australia could become the fourth country in the world to legalize medicinal weed exports in order to score a piece of the estimated $55 billion global market.

**SPOTIFY IPO**

Spotify, valued at $19 billion has confidentially filed for an IPO with U.S. regulators and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018, which would be the first major company to carry out a direct listing, an unconventional way to pursue an IPO without raising new capital.

The **GBPUSD** added a bit on the green side, seems to trying to make its way to 1.365. When it clears the level and close the long term existing gap, it will go higher. 1.3333 continues to offer a floor, expect pull back to the area.

7oa4a1,1515144021,msft,Suggestion: 2D Menus when you click the windows button,"I just started using my Odyssey this week and with the exception of one issue I love it. I love the effortless tracking set up, the controllers work fine, and the screen resolution is really nice compared to others. 

That said I have one major issue with WMR and that's the fact it is a MAJOR resource hog. Like some others have pointed out, its clear MSFT is caching the entire Cliff experience in your GPUs VRAM. As soon as the MR app/experience opens I see 2/4GBs on my RX580 get eaten up instantly. When I leave the Cliff House for Steam VR or other experiences that VRAM doesn't open back up, everything just keeps stacking on top of each other. It appears this is done to allow you to transport back to the Cliff house from anywhere. However that's a really odd user experience. The windows button on the Odyssey's remotes are very easily triggered, and I've accidentally clicked them a few times before. Why wouldn't you utilize a simple 2D pop up menu which gives me the choice of returning to the Cliff house or resuming my activity, as opposed to forcing me back to the house whether I intended to or not. A 2D menu, like Steams, would also help alleviate the VRAM issues on the GPUs and allow a much more enjoyable experience for WMR owners trying out new experiences. 

Please MSFT, help us out and get rid of the ghost of the Cliff house on our GPUs and let us have more controll over our experiences with the wonderful products you've helped bring to market. ",1

7ob3tm,1515157785,gme,The wait is OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bit the bullet and went on ahead and bought another PS3 just for NCAA 14! Hadn't played since the initial release. 

I wasn't aware of the lawsuit so I traded 2 Xbox 360s and a PS3 to go towards my XBOX One. I was under the impression that every game that was released that fall would be available within months on the One. 

Boy did that Gamestop associate sell me false dreams. 

Had to wait on shipping because I'm currently out of the country, but its here now! LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL! Cant wait to see  these in-gme traditions again!",1

7oc04y,1515167219,nvda,A brief macroeconomic analysis of TRX and Crypto,"Theoretical adoption/implementation of Tron (TRX) and the overall Cryptocurrency market: a brief macroeconomic analysis

If you're reading this I'm assuming you already have a bullish investment thesis on cryptocurrency; chances are you wouldn't be on this sub-reddit if you didn't. So I'll skip the value proposition and tech analysis. This isn't a price-hype post, but there will be some financial statistics and market cap quotes so bear with me. 

1) In 2014 the worldwide GDP was estimated at approximately $78.3 Trillion 

2) As of writing the worldwide physical Gold market is valued at approximately $8 Trillion 

3) In July of 2017,  the worldwide stock market was valued at approximately $76.3 Trillion (not to be confused with the world GDP figure above, they're separate) 

4) Worldwide debt is valued at approximately $215 Trillion


5) The combined value of the all the world's real estate is estimated at around $217 Trillion 

So some basic addition gives us a combined total value of approximately $594 Trillion. The nominal USD value of Earth, depending on how you calculate things. 




As of writing this the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is just under $780 Billion. With a B instead of a T this time. 

So let's just assume cryptocurrency achieves solid adoption and achieves a 1% overall share of the that massive that $594 Trillion value figure: 

$594 Trillion x 1% = $5.94 Trillion 

That's an growth rate of 761.5% from current market cap. 

So now let's get a little crazier and assume cryptocurrency achieves a 5% overall share of the $594 Trillion value figure: 

$594 Trillion x 5% = $29.7 Trillion ......... 

That's an growth rate of 3,807% from current market cap. We're not talking about hype growth here, that's overall market cap growth. 

So I think you've gotten the point by now. But like a goddamn Steve Job's keynote presentation, we saved the best for last. 
The Worldwide Derivatives Market, valued at estimated $1.2 Quadrillion dollars. For those who don't know, derivatives are essentially investment securities based on the value of a underlying asset. Think Futures and Options. This is a good introduction article if you want to know more: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp

Anyways, $1.2 Quadrillion dollars.

Here's a written out side by side comparison with the current crypto market cap: 

$1,200,000,000,000,000  
         $780,000,000,000

Currently the cryptocurrency market is a mere 0.065% of the worldwide derivatives market cap. 

So if we added $1.4 Quadrillion to our previously calculated $594 Trillion, we get a grand total of $1.994 Quadrillion. 

Obtaining 1% of that overall market would give cryptocurrency a market cap of $19,940,000,000,000 or $19.94 Trillion. 

So my point is, realistically things are just getting started here in the mystical land of cryptocurrency. But this brings me to my next point; as everyone is aware people In my opinion there will be a market correction in the near future, followed by a rapid continued increase in overall market value. Somewhat reminiscent of the 90s Dotcom bubble, but fundamentally different in a few ways. Like the dotcom bubble, a collapse is required to end this uneducated cycle of careless hype-driven ""investing"". Just because a cryptocurrency has it's own blockchain or ERC20 token or a ""A+"" ICO ranking from a affiliate marketing blogger doesn't mean anything. For about $10,000 I could have one too. There's over 1,300 cryptocurrencies; the vast majority of them aren't worth anything. Some are outright scams. When this mass sell-off occurs, money will move from pseudo-crypto to the legitimate cryptocurrency projects. Only the creme-de-le-creme will be left standing. Like we've already seen in cryptocurrency, this will occur over a very short time span. The ease of accessibility has allowed a lot of naive hype-based folks to invest money. When the market experiences this large correction, panic sellers will send money in 2 ways: to fiat and to the creme-de-le-creme coins/tokens. I think many of these hype investors will actually keep the money in crypto to attempt to recoup lost profits. Essentially the market will consolidate into a smaller number of legitimate cryptocurrencies, and much of the currently invested capital will simply be transferred to legitimate projects. This will cause the prices of legitimate cryptocurrencies to pullback slightly, and then explode upward. 

So to weed out the worthless projects from the promising projects you must heavily vet. Vet and then vet again. For starters consider these 4 aspects: 

1) technological value and feasibility: you must deconstruct white papers and all available technical material! Learn a programming language, read CS forums, phone a friend. 

2) Project team, management, advisors: look for teams with relevant background experience obviously; age isn't exactly a factor but maturity is. Buterin is 23 years old. Justin Sun is on Forbes 30 under 30. But be wary, these are shining examples and not the norm. Advisors are very important as well, as they can help hone in the raw talent and provide invaluable networking. 

3) Current Partnerships/Applications: massive factor in my mind. We can talk theoretically all day, but when it comes down to it having actual clients/users will be what expands the crypto ecosystem. Partnering with services and business carves out a cryptocurrency's niche, giving it a basis for value. 

4) target market conditions: who else is working on the same concept? What differentiates this project from one's similar like it? Do legal restrictions and government regulations hurt or help the project? Ex. Tron is rumored to be working to be regulated through the Chinese government, which could lead to faster mass adoption of TRX in China.

Vetting is what leads to good investments. Pick solid projects and stick with them. Allocate a small monthly investment slush fund if you really need to try exceedingly risky trades. Create your own strategy and opinion, and fact check everyone.  


So with all this being said: 

In my opinion, this is only the beginning for Tron and cryptocurrency as a whole. With upcoming updates and further partnerships, TRX will be a shining star in the cryptocurrency world (epitomizing it's founder's last name). I do believe ETH, XLM, XRP, VEN, and TRX are best positioned currently due to current partnerships and implemented usage. I would recommend also looking at WTC, REQ, ADA, QTUM, IOTA, NEO, and the privacy coin trio: XVG, XMR, ZEC. I'm not here to shill coins, so I'm done. 

Like any investment, please only invest what you can afford to lose. A lot of cryptos will fail in the near future, so diversification is the key to success. Pick a handful of vetted projects you like and believe will be valuable and allocate funds responsibly. Just because you love a particular cryptocurrency doesn't mean you should allocate 50% of your holdings to it. In stock trading, many abide by 5% rule to mitigate risk: never invest more than 5% of your overall trading capital per security. Stay on top of the cryptos you invest in, keep up with news, and constantly reanalyze. Learn some technical analysis and day trade if you feel so inclined. But the goal is to accumulate more, not withdrawal shorter profits to fiat. I firmly believe that the bulk of the market cap growth in the cryptocurrency ecosystem will go towards Alt-coins, not Bitcoin. The overall market cap will easily be over $10 Trillion by 2025. With this much capital influx there will undoubtedly be efforts by the traditional financial sector to manipulate the market. Whales, dark web coalitions, pump/dump telegram groups, etc already make a killing running such scams. A wall street office of 20 quantitative economists could mastermind a manipulation scheme so sophisticatedly it would be largely unnoticed. Hedge funds, banks, and investment firms manipulate the market constantly; what makes anyone think they're going to pass up on crypto? That's the largest risk in my mind. And sure many things could happen that could negatively impact the whole cryptocurrency market, like government regulations (or ether cats). The overall blockchain-ecosystem will grow; decentralization is the future. 

Closing words of unsolicited advice: 
Don't be the person who owned 10,000 shares of NVDA at $22, but sold at $44. If you believe in an investment thesis and there's an analytical basis to your belief, stick with it. The goal of cryptocurrency trading should be to increase the amount of crypto-capital you have, not fiat capital. The global economy could very well divert to operating exclusively in cryptocurrency, making fiat obsolete. But again that is simply speculation. If you don't feel comfortable trading or it just isn't your thing, just buy and hold. And while you're holding, learn how to trade. 



TLDR: That's one small step for man....

That shakes when you laugh like a bowl full of jelly;

My scanners can see you, but still I insist,

Since you're not in my program, you cannot exist!""

    
 

Since this is an inaugural devlog of this year it’s only fair to talk a bit about upcoming updates and plans.
We decided to have two updates per month instead of one. 

“But how is it possible?” You might ask.

“How are you going to manage such a feat with such a small team?”

Don’t fret over it. We decided to divide updates by main themes.

First one will be dedicated to the mechanics . Those will be the most apparent changes. 
Introduction of new minds, levels, skills and/or weapons. Heck maybe even new colors (blue anyone?). Additionally this update will go along with a regular Dev Stream, where we will talk about new content and behave in an unprofessional manner.

Second one is for those who like to dive deep into the story. I mean **deep**. 
You will have to explore the obscure and weird parts of SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE to be able to grasp the story. Plot will unfold along with the progress of developement. Each update will bring new and fresh bits of story. Think of it as a monthly episode of SUPERHOT tv series but to watch it you have to put some effort and wait. No binge watching through this one.

Obviously, both updates will be accompanied by a healthy dose of bugfixes and smoothing out of gameplay (stuff most people usually don't notice but it keeps us awake at night).

First Game Mechanics update of this year will drop on 11th January, following by Story update on 25th January.

I will give you a short glimpse into it for now. 
You will be able to give it a go yourself when it drops next week.

7ogyyv,1515211983,msft,Just hit half-a-million!,"Hit a new milestone tonight.  Just wanted to share with someone.  Started at 23 with nothing, but did have a decent job starting in a call center.  

13 years later, I hit half a million in Net Worth, and I just bought my first investment property! (I will close on it in February)

https://imgur.com/a/aPsYg

Edit: I've had a few PM's and enough people ask what I did to achieve this.

Quite frankly, I treated debt like it was a plague.  I didn't get my first credit card until I was in my early 20's, and I've *never* carried a balance.  I never went to college, so I have no college debt. (This is probably a major factor in my success.)  I'm not going to knock college education, and I don't want anyone thinking that not going to college is the way to get this kind of money, but it was a major contributor to my success.  Not having a college debt, and just working hard and learning in a computer technical field (one of the few fields where college used to not matter as much unless you were a programmer) contributed to my success.  I focused on scripting languages, and became so good at them, that I built automated systems for companies.  
*I want to be clear on this.*  Experts say college degrees are still the best way to get ahead financially in life, and that people with solid degrees will ultimately do better than those of us without.  However, there is some merit in ""the plumber, the carpenter, the handyman"" and those types of jobs, where no college degree was ever had, but they build success on their own.  I think a lot of kids overlook these types of trades, and I've seen my share of very very successful people.  I also think sometimes carrying a college debt, and not nailing a great job as soon as you step out of college can be depressing, and this may impact performance in a work place.  I have no idea, but the experts say otherwise, so I trust them.  In the end, with compounding interest, there could be an argument that unless you get out of college with $X amount in salary versus $Y debt, it may take you years to catch a person who never went to college, with no debt.  It's like the math problem of an 18 year old investing $5000/year into the market from 18 until 23 years old, and then NEVER invests again, versus a 23 year old starting to invest $5000/year into the market at the same growth rate.  Go do the math.  Go see how many years and how much money it takes the 23 year old to invest to finally catch the investments of the 18 year old!  It's a fun math problem to do, and it's one of the biggest inspirations I've ever had.  Go teach your kids this problem too!

Simply put, I focused hard on system automation, and was very good at it.  This landed me side by side with ""degree'd"" engineers, earning the same amount of money as them, but without the debt of college. 

As far as investments are concerned, I started investing 12% into my 401k early on, and I invested heavily in Latin America stock, mostly PBR (go look it up).  PBR was also a luck factor, because it skyrocketed before the 2008 crash, and I (innocently and luckily) got out of it about 6 months before the crash.  I had no clue what I was doing in those days, and was just looking up stocks that had massive returns because I was stupid.  (Today I'm mostly in stable tech companies like MSFT and ORCL.)  Anyways, that massive boost early on from PBR really got my investments going ridiculously early, up to something like 60k in the first 2 years.  I also bought National City (the bank) just before they were bought by PNC, and that bump helped a little.  I really fumbled through stocks, dangerously in those days.  That helped me build up a small but decent net worth early.  I eventually moved to the ""100% - age"" model, and put a percentage of my funds into low volatility bonds based on my age.  At some point, I also increased my paycheck contribution to 14%, and never looked back.   

Why do I have so much cash?  I just completed a contract, and that cash is going towards that investment property I mentioned above, so it's not going to remain as such. 

I also dumped heavily into TSLA back when it was around $100/share. (Yes.. I know all you 'savvy' folks, I know), but TSLA really gave me a boost as well.  I've since sold out of it mostly, but I still hold some shares ""just in case"". 

But if I were to name the single thing I've done to help boost my net worth so effectively, it would be paying down debt.  You lose SO MUCH MONEY to interest.  I paid down my house with GOBS of extra cash on principal every month, and did a 15-year finance, instead of a 30-year.  I also bought a house in what is now luckily a growing area, and I didn't buy a very big house.  ""Experiences, not things"" is my motto to live by. So we try to not buy too many things, and that allows us to save for events, and the rest of the cash goes towards debts.    

The next goal is to close on this investment property, and begin the potentially risky venture into being a landlord on the side.  The area the house is in is in an area with one of the best elementary schools in the state, so the goal is to cater to young families that want their kids in that school.  I was able to negotiate a great deal on the property, and pull in a very low interest rate (for an investment property.. 4.5%), by putting 25% down on it.  (Part of that cash I mentioned earlier.)  

At this point, I simply watch the market for major ups and downs as a signal for collapse.  They say you can't predict the market, but I did a couple of times based on (probably stupid) ideas, like when China crashed hard in 2015, I pulled out of the U.S. market because I firmly believe these things do not happen in a vaccuum.  Sure enough, our market dropped 10% (go look at .DJI on google finance), and I got back in.  Things like that have helped give me boosts here and there.  But at the end of the day, contribute as much as you can stand to the market, live in a smaller home, carry as little debt as you can, and before you know it, your money will be growing.  That's really it.  From where I'm standing, it's honestly nothing special.  No magic formula, no major number crunching, just consistency.  I don't ""want"" things very much, so I don't give in to many temptations. ",0

The only concern of the government is whether the infrastructure for e rickshaws and other vehicles in the Electrical Vehicle (EV) sector would get adequately developed by such time. However, with the present developments taking place in the sector, we are surely moving into the right direction.

This is becoming more evident from the fact that the number of e-rickshaw charging points in Northern India is increasing. Apart from this Exide the major battery maker will be supplying electric batteries for the electric rickshaws shortly.

**Growth in No. of Electric Rickshaw at North MCD Parking**

In a major step towards streamlining the parking of electric auto rickshaws in the city and avoid congestion on roads, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has taken a major step. This is to set up charging points for the battery-operated vehicles at select parking lots in its jurisdiction.
The agency has finalized six spots where the facility would be developed. The same is likey to be made ready by the end of next month. The battery operated rickshaw drivers would be able to charge their vehicles at nominal prices during night.

The locations include the North MCD parking lots near Badli Metro station, village Singhalpur (Haryana irrigation canal), Railway Reservation Office near Kela godown, Keshavpuram and Sector 11, Rohini. This is indeed a major step for the development of e rickshaw sector in Delhi.

To conclude, we can say with the developments which are taking place over all to boost the E-rickshaw sector it is sure that it offers great scope for battery operated rickshaw owners. So in case you are looking to develop a lucrative business owing electric rickshaws could indeed be the right thing to do. We at Jezza Motors offer the best quality electric rickshaws at the most affordable rates. To know more about our Electric vehicles products you can check our website.",0
7ojll9,1515250000,nvda,i'm starting to go blind and i have a lot of questions,"i'm 14 (15 in february), i have strabismus as well as myopia in both eyes but worse in my right. i have almost no depth perception anymore. i can't get the surgery to fix it because of other things i have. i don't have a cane but i'm hoping to get one soon.

how do you deal with people who think you're faking? that's my main problem. even my mom does, even though i'm diagnosed. i have enough vision to get around, use a computer, etc, so people think i'm not really low vision even when i run into walls and shit.

what screenreaders do you recommend for chromebooks? i have to use one for school and the built in screenreader is shit. i use nvda on my personal laptop, and i like it a lot.

how do i deal with school stuff? i know i'm going to have to talk to the administration about getting a screenreader, plus i'm already getting bullied for being disabled, so i know it's only going to get worse if i get a cane. my mom isn't behind me, she's really against me being visibly disabled and it was hell to even use my crutches at school.

with school, should i be leaving my classes earlier or something? there was a blind girl who did that, and i'm scared of getting my cane stepped on (people make it a game or something to step on my crutches).

does anyone use crutches and a cane? i'm thinking i'll go down to one crutch and on bad days i won't use my cane and use two crutches.

how do you convince a doctor you need a cane? again, my mom isn't backing me, so i'm kind of on my own. i've been running into things, mainly furniture and a lot of people. my vision is only going to get worse from here, and i know that. my insurance only covers one opthamologist visit a year, and by the end of 2018 i'm probably going to be done for.

is there anything i can do to make life easier? just general tips? i have a ton of extensions and stuff for accessibility on my computer, i know how to turn on descriptive audio on netflix and amazon video, i have a screenreader and i know how to use it, i can identify my animals by how they sound when they walk, all that.

i'm sorry this is a lot, but i'm the only low vision/blind person in my area that i know of except for a girl who's in the middle school. this is kind of my only resource until i can get to o&amp;m.",1

Gonna wait for a small pull back before I purchase, the entire market has been red hot recently, with MCD and LMT looking more highly valued currently. Though the time horizon is long so I won't be too picky on the exact price and can average in later.

7omk8r,1515278506,nvda,Credit Spreads- Please add additional insight,"This thread has been a great resource to me as a trader, so I definitely would like to give back. I've been selling credit spreads (bull puts, bear calls, iron condors) in the past year along with call spreads and put spreads, so I'd like to offer my takeaways on this. 

Timeframe- This is one of the biggest questions people ask about selling credit spreads. I like to look for around 45 days unless I'd like to avoid the IV ramp (selling options that expire before earnings). This allows me to still get the theta ramp up, while at the same time avoiding too much gamma. (The stock moving strongly in one direction, and blowing my strikes out of the park). 

OTM/ITM/ATM- For selling credit spreads, I look to sell spreads that are OTM for 45 days or so. This is due to the fact that I've found research that states that OTM options lose their value the quickly up until the last 30 days (most of their value is gone) while the ATM options lose most of their values in the last 30 days. This is essential as you would like to sell options when they still have value to lose. 

Strikes- For iron condors, I look for .2 delta or so on each side, while on bear calls or bull puts, I look for .3 delta. This is more of a self preference, but the more important part is the options are OTM and they are valued right, which brings me to my next point. 

Valuation- The valuation on credit spreads is slightly different from buying straight options, so I'd like to share how I value the spreads myself. I primarily value the spreads based on delta and Risk vs reward when coming up with my personal value. For my example, NVDA 205 puts are at .33 delta, and I'm selling the 205/200 put spread. This means I want at least a .33 reward/risk. This means I value the put spread at 1.25 dollars because 1.25 reward/ 3.75 (5-1.25) risk = .33 which is the same as delta. If the market is offering over this, I will take it if I believe in the direction. As of EOD prices, the put spreads are 1.32, slightly better than the .33 delta. 

Profit Taking- Most newbies like to go for the full premium, because why leave money on the table, but the best strategy is to go for 50%. An analogy would be a timed buffet. Pretend there is an unlimited chicken buffet, but limited time, you would eat the middle of the chicken and move onto the next chicken rather than eating the parts with the bones. It applies to options as well, sell the options, collect most of the meat, and allow someone else to eat the meat on the bones while you move onto the next credit spread. 

Finally, if you get a 25% profit immediately (talking within a week or so) , I would look to take profits immediately and either rolling the spread to a higher delta/ strike or find anther stock to look at. I've had a lot of positions go into the toilet when they lost value quickly, but I waited for the elusive 50%. (Ahem SQ) 

Finally- My valuation method works generally well for debit spreads as well, but be a bit more wary of the value when having wider spreads. For example, if I buy a 30 delta call, but then sell a way OTM call spread, it might look like a great deal, but it actually isn't.

Commissions- This is a big one and I'm still wary on anyone with high commissions to do credit spreads unless you are selling spreads on high priced stocks or have a flat rate monthly option subscription. Most of the time, a simple credit spread (call or put) has a commission at the cheapest at 2 dollars roundtrip. If you are selling a .20 or .30 premium, you are giving your broker a huge cut of your potential profits (remember you're going for 50%), not my favorite type of trading. Try to negotiate your prices to something you are content with or avoid trading spreads, it's crazy ridiculous. I believe this is the best way to take advantage of robinhood free options trading. 

Hope this thread is a great help; anyone that trades option spreads please share your tips. If you find anything you disagree with, please do comment!

7on2kz,1515283518,msft,Big Companies Using Blockchain in 2018,"These stocks, in my opinion, are solid companies that are delving into the blockchain for 2018 and beyond. These are NOT penny stocks whose entire company is based on blockchain. If you are a visual learner, you can watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/jOBKNzp9i_k)


1. Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)
- 
- Broadridge provides investor communications and other solutions to the financial sector. They are one of the pioneers in this industry.
* Broadridge is a standing out in the blockchain trend bc they’ve already completing a successful pilot test of a blockchain-based technology in collaboration with two large European banks in October.
* The company partnered with JPMorgan in 2016 to successfully test its technology with shareholder proxy voting to make it easier and more transparent. Considering BR was already the largest U.S. provider of proxy voting services, it made sense for it to step in here.
2. MasterCard (MA)
- 
* Mastercard announced that it is now opening up its blockchain to certain banks and merchants as an alternative and potentially more efficient method of paying for goods and services.
* They are targeting cross-border payments between businesses as the primary purpose for its blockchain, which can only be used by invitation.
* Mastercard’s blockchain operates independently and instead accepts payments in traditional local money which is seen by some as a positive. 
3. Microsoft (MSFT)
- 
* Microsoft is committed to bringing blockchain to the enterprise and they are working with customers, partners, and the blockchain community to continue advancing its enterprise readiness through it’s COCO Framework
* Coco will be compatible, by design, with any ledger protocol and can operate in the cloud and on premises
* By design, Coco is open and compatible with any blockchain protocol. Microsoft has already begun integrating E
* Microsoft’s intent is to contribute the source code to the dev community in early 2018
4. Visa (V)
- 
* Visa has rolled out the first, pilot phase of its blockchain-based business-to-business payments service, B2B Connect.
* Similar to MasterCard, Visa plans to use the platform to ease cross-border payments by facilitating direct payments between institutions, cutting out the middleman the industry currently relies on.
* Visa's global head of solutions, Kevin Phalen, said that the banks are trialing live bank-to-bank transactions over the platform. Following this first phase of the project, phase two will see the project move to a commercial launch, slated to occur in the middle of 2018
5. Cisco Systems (CSCO)
- 
* Cisco is one of the 200 organizations that are a part of the Enterprise E Alliance. These are governments and companies from all over the world, and multiple industries, testing out a version of E's blockchain
* Cisco is also working to craft its own blockchain systems. In October, the company filed for the trademark of a blockchain platform that can identify different connected devices, monitor the activity of those devices, and evaluate how trustworthy those devices are when connected to a network. 
* It would also continually and automatically assess new devices when added to the network. In other words, Cisco believes it has a game-changing blockchain to track the Internet of Things.",0

7oq2dj,1515323456,nvda,I took out a 50k personal loan before Christmas and invested it. Here are the results (With screens),"[Gains/Losses] (https://imgur.com/a/DYUeK)



[Loan](https://imgur.com/a/MX8H1)

I started trading in February of last year. My initial investment was building with regular deposits and got up to $36,954 by December.

After the great tech crash (late nov early dec), my initial investment went down to $20,429 (45% loss). I was invested with something like 4x margin in all tech. Before the crash, my portfolio was worth $56,566 (65% return).

In a depressed drunken stupor, I decided to apply for a personal loan and either get my money back or go down in a glorious ball of flames.

So far I have made back my initial investment in the first trading week of 2018 + 9k. I plan to pay back the loan in full Feb 2, 2018 for a total cost of ~$2k interest. 

Holdings during this period: SQ, SHOP, NVDA, YUMC, AMD, STZ (loss)

Follow your dreams WSB and take out personal loans to YOLO with.",1
7os4ly,1515348304,tsla,A defense of the sub,"Every now and then, I'm going to feel the need to respond to misguided/untrue statements regarding our sub...

""r/realtesla is nothing more than group therapy for Tesla shorts and right-wing nutjobs who just can't believe that EVs are a good idea. There is more BS there than in the streets of Pamplona. A bunch of ""geniuses"" who have thought really hard about Tesla while mowing their lawn and come to firm unshakeable conclusions, evidence be damned.""


Let's discuss this.


In order :


1) there is very little discussion of the stock price or personal investing on this sub.  There's plenty of discussion of the *financial state of the company*, but very little pertaining to ""let's talk about making money on TSLA"".  It's not like we have a weekly thread to talk about investing....

2) ""right-wing nutjobs who just can't believe that EVs are a good idea.""  Interesting.  Then why are there frequent posts about the Bolt, Leaf, and other Tesla competitors and how they will affect the market?  Please cite one post that is anti-EV.  Go look. Find one.   Also try to find a pro-Trump or otherwise political post or comment.

3) ""evidence be damned""?? You want to talk about *evidence*?  Like, missed production targets evidence?  Quarterly losses evidence?  2,300 Models in all of 2017 evidence?  Please - the obvious skew and biases aside, we do deal in evidence here, far more than where you made your comment, where ""Elon said"" is considered proof.",1
7ot0f9,1515356188,nvda,5 Stocks to watch this week [Jan8-12],"Last week was absolutely amazing. I hope everyone here had good gains and took profits as well! My picks from last week did exceptionally well:

* GOOGL - 5.4%

* BABA - 10.6%

* V - 4.24%

* PYPL - 6.9%

* QQQ - 3.95%


Looking into this week, we are due for some consolidation or pullback, but there are a still plays that could work out this week. As always, I have this in video format [which you can watch here](https://youtu.be/PoibBodbkLU) if you don't want to read this block of text.

1. Apple (AAPL) - So although tech had a big week, Apple kind of lagged behind. It's a slow mover, BUT, once it gets moving, it makes big moves. The technicals show it's at a critical point for a breakout, so keep a close eye on this. If we see any news leak about positive iPhone 10 sales over the holiday season, expect this to go to ATH. Also ER is scheduled for Feb 1, so we will most likely see a run up soon enough.


2. Nvidia (NVDA) - Solid company, and it had a rough couple of months after breaking the $200 level. Now we're back, and with CES around the corner, I suspect this will have a good move as well. Earnings again I believe is in Feb. If you look @ the technicals, you can see that it broke a key uptrend resistance level on STRONG volume - this is a very good sign for the stock as buyers have come back in and believe it should move higher. When Nvidia gets moving, we see it move A LOT, so this is a good one to watch this week.


3. Square (SQ) - Recovering from ATH of $50 from couple months ago, Square is starting to make a comeback. We saw it bottom out around $34 or so (I personally wanted it to $30, but that's fine...) and now we see some movement upwards. Once again, we broke resistance on good volume, and now we bounced off support (and the 50 day) with STRONG volume. This is good confirmation that we are ready to start heading back to the ATH of $50 in this stock, but it may take a few weeks to get there. Friday had amazing movement, and overall I think we have a lot more room to move here. I personally picked up some LEAPs (Jan 2019 expiry, 50C) and they were fairly cheap. I don't think we'll have any problems seeing Square back at $50 before Jan 2019...


4. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) - They got a nice rally thanks to the news that came out from EA last week. Typically gaming stocks like to follow each others movement (EA, ATVI, TTWO), but I think technically, TTWO has the best charts and the best potential for a swing trade. If you look @ the charts, you can see that it broke through a key resistance level, on good volume, so we should be watching it closely next week to see if volume continues on with this. The stock has been beaten down since making new ATH a few months ago, although nothing fundamentally changed, so I think we'll see a good move up in the upcoming weeks as long as the market keeps moving up.


5. Walmart (WMT) - This is a new stock I've never covered on my 5 stocks weekly videos, but the consolidation on this caught my attention. I have a position in them, longer dated calls, because I do believe we are just waiting for a Catalyst to gap up and move higher. This is the first time the stock closed above $100, which is typically a big resistance point for a stock to get past. It has consolidated around here since its last ER, and this move up was expected. Now as long as volume comes in, we could see this at $105-$110 before the next ER. If we see news come out that they had a record holiday season or something like this, I expect it to gap up and start a good rally. Walmart is a slow mover though, so it may take a few weeks to see movement here, but keep an eye on it!


So that covers the 5 stocks for this week. As always, please comment below to share what stocks you're watching this week, what you think about these 5 stocks that I covered, and how you did with your picks from the previous week.

7oumwj,1515371104,nflx,Sell NFLX,"I'll get straight to the point: Netflix is completely overvalued and anyone who owns it should start taking profits. The main reason for this is competition. Netflix used to have a moat in two different ways: It had contracts with companies that gave Netflix the sole right to stream their content and it was the first mover and no one wanted to compete with them. The first one obviously isn't true anymore simply because these contracts are expiring. Not only that. but the companies that made these contracts 4 or 5 years ago no longer like them or the contracts aren't profitable for them. This is why so many shows are now leaving Netflix. 

This leads to the collapse of the second moat. Companies now *do* want to compete with Netflix, particularly large companies, and they have the opportunity to because these shows are leaving the Netflix platform. Another big problem isn't the tv shows that are leaving Netflix, but instead the movies. Most people use Netflix to watch TV shows, and it's limited selection of movies was never a problem because while it lacked older movies, it did get new popular movies that a large audience watches. Mainly Disney and Marvel. However, a huge blow has been struck against this part of the platform because Disney is in the process of pulling all of it's movies from the platform and moving them to it's own streaming service. This especially alienates the family demographic, which is a very large part of the people that use the Netflix streaming service. 

While competition is obviously heating up with new streaming services coming out all the time such as HBO, Amazon Video, and especially Disney and Hulu now that Disney owns Hulu, it is also worrying that the pie is getting smaller. What I mean by that is, most people that are going to use a streaming service by now, use a streaming service. Potential customers are becoming rarer and rarer, at the same time competition is heating up, which is a very dangerous combination for Netflix. Another huge issue is how easy it is to switch from one streaming service to another. It takes maybe 5 minutes to go from Netflix to HBO or Hulu, a practice I find myself doing more and more often as tv shows fluctuate from service to service along with prices. (Which Netflix has been unyielding on.)

Now for the value issue. Netflix has soared over 40% over the last year along with the market. It is part of everyone's favorite ETF, FANG, which is propelling it forward to even higher valuations. For the reasons stated above, I don't think that this can continue. 

tl;dr: Competition is heating up, Netflix doesn't have a moat, and it's valuation is unreasonable.

I'm not the type to predict the coming demise of popular companies, but I can't ignore the fact the Netflix simply doesn't deserve it's valuation anymore. And I'm a growth investor, I normally couldn't care less. Thanks for reading if you did read all that.",0

With U.S. stocks seeming to hit records by the day, perhaps its no surprise that investors are piling into risk assets in a nearly unprecedented way.
In the latest measure of optimism,  TD Ameritrade's  Investor Movement Index rose to 8.59 in December, its second straight monthly record. The index measures the behavior of  TD Ameritrade  clients, aggregating their positions and activity to measure how they are positioned.
""Retail investors ended 2017 with exposure at all-time highs. Our clients were net buyers during December, resulting in one of the longest buying streaks in the history of the [index],""  TD Ameritrade  wrote in a press release.
The index score is high, relative to historic ranges, and it comes at a time when stocks have been hitting repeated records. The  S&amp;P  500 , after a gain of nearly 20% in 2017, has closed at records in the first four trading sessions of 2018--the first time it has accomplished such a fear since 1964. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index have also been hitting records on a regular basis.

Margin debt, which is viewed as a measure of speculation, has been at elevated levels all year. According to the most recent data from  NYSE , it hit  $580.95 billion  at the end of November, its fifth record in a row, and up 3.5% from October. Records aren't rare--according to data from  Bespoke Investment Group , more than 23% of all monthly readings are records--but debt has been creeping up basically all year. The 11 highest readings on record all occurred in the 11 completed months of 2017.

&gt;The iPhone has made Apple Inc. AAPL -0.07% and Wall Street hundreds of billions of dollars. Now some big shareholders are asking at what cost, in an unusual campaign to make the company more socially responsible.

&gt;A leading activist investor and a pension fund are saying the smartphone maker needs to respond to what some see as a growing public-health crisis of youth phone addiction.

&gt;Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares, sent a letter to Apple on Saturday urging it to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.

&gt;Some have raised concerns about increased rates in teen depression and suicide and worry that phones are replacing old-fashioned human interaction. It is part of a broader re-evaluation of the effects on society of technology companies such as Google and Amazon.com Inc. and social-media companies like Facebook Inc. and Snap chat owner Snap Inc., which are facing questions about their reach into everyday life.",0

...yeah.

I said yes I was and what you need to do is shut the fuck up!! 

Police officer was sitting there eating his meal, unawares to me. told me to me to calm down.

I'm scared as shit cuz I'm black and drunk,  I said...my fault😬.

7p5ob4,1515484775,nvda,$AAOI finally ready for a breakout,"edit: nevermind, this turd keeps falling, support got broken 5 min after open (that was fast)

After decreased guidance due to Amazon (one of their biggest customers) decreasing demand on their 40G fiber, it has been free falling since August from $100 to currently $38,37.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaoi

I have been doing the dirty job for you to catch and baghold this POS at $60, $50, $40 and $38. It finally seems to have consolidated with a support a bit above $37. Also for the past week volume has been very low compared to average and according to finviz it has a short float of 60%. So on good news this should burst.

The risk is that they were too dependent on Amazon, the company fundamentals seems to be solid and undervalued at the moment due to FUD. Current P/E=9, forward P/E=11, P/S=1.9. Since november some insiders like director Alan Moore have started to get back in in bulk. 

Market sector has been flat-downish, other relevant competitors might be $OCLR or $FNSR.

tl;dr: Possible short squeeze (consolidation, low volume, high short float). Still risky, put stop loss in case it breaks support below $37. Long AMD, NVDA, MU",1

7p5xrq,1515488773,nvda,SPECTACULAR NUMBERS,"Watching Wall Street boast its best start to a year in over a decade, investors are turning their focus to the fourth quarter earnings season, with results beginning to trickle in this week. Traders are focusing on the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which could provide breathtaking numbers, but  it will not affect stock prices much.


**ECONOMIES**

German factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slipped by 0.4% in November after three months of gains. The dip was largely due to fluctuations in bulk orders but the overall trend remains positive. 
China's forex reserves posted an eleventh straight monthly increase in December, $20.7B, taking the full-year increase of the world's largest foreign-currency stockpile to $129B.

The FED should raise interest rates three times this year, given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts.


**ARAMCO’s 5% IS FOR SALE**

Aligning its strategy with peers, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), CEO Ben van Beurden said that growth of competitor Shell's (RDS.A) oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production. On what else?! Candies? What a discovery!
Saudi Aramco and some of the kingdom's biggest companies said they'll pay Saudi staff more money, matching a royal order amid rising prices. Saudi Arabia seeks to sell as much as 5% of Aramco.


**CRYPTO**

The SEC has received a request to allow five bitcoin-related ETFs to be listed on Arca, a secondary marketplace on the NYSE. The instruments, are not tied to the price of the cryptocurrency itself, but would track bitcoin futures.


**AT&amp;T BACKS DOWN**

AT&amp;T (T) is backing away from a plan to sell phones made by Chinese handset giant Huawei, on the eve of a big announcement of the deal. The deal that Huawei was set to announce tomorrow would have been its first partnership with a major U.S. carrier, but AT&amp;T has changed its mind. So far it is not clear why AT&amp;T backed down, but there are two issues occur. Are Huawei's phones carry spyware? Is it because the US wants to have domestic competition? At one point we’ll have the answer.


**THERE ARE NO JEDIS IN CHINA**

$36 million in third-week grosses, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Sony) finally toppled Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney) from the top of the box-office charts. Disney made an impressive $1.2 billion, but it is far from the estimated $2 billion. It seems that China has no Jedis, the movie made only 26% of expectations in the country. The Force is weak in China.


**NVIDIA, VOLKSWAGEN, UBER, AI**

Making further gains in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nvidia (NVDA) is partnering with Uber and Volkswagen on AI platforms. So far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers, or sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, proven that there is more than cryptomining to the company!


**WHIRLPOOL KICKS OFF CES2018**

Apple (AAPL) Watch users will soon have the ability to control Whirlpool (WHR) appliances through the wearable. Whirlpool announced the development at CES and said the compatibility would come later this year to 20 connected appliances.  Whirlpool says Amazon (AMZN) Alexa and Google (GOOGC) Assistant voice controls will also arrive in 2018.


**SPACEX - THE FIRST LAUNCH OF 2018**

SpaceX successfully launched a secret U.S. government payload called Zuma on Sunday and landed its rocket back on Earth. The Falcon 9 powered a spacecraft made by Northrop Grumman, which was sent into low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is now looking towards its next challenge, launching the Falcon Heavy - its largest rocket to date - at the end of January, meanwhile Tesla’s stock price soared higher.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Amazon (AMZN)** Alexa Onboard was introduced yesterday. Another green day.

**Electronic Arts (EA)** is upgraded to Buy, new PT is $130.

**Applied Materials (AMAT)** also got an upgrade, double bottom formed, ready to rock!

**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** had great presentation at JPM Healthcare conference. Climbing steady.

**PayPal (PYPL)** one day transfer, instant debit card transfer. Smells like blockchain integration. But who cares?! $86 on the way. Tight stop people!


**FX WORLD**

Not a lot happened on Monday, mostly momentum trading was possible. It doesn’t seem to be busy today either, still look for the correct entry points!
The EURUSD initially took off to the upside, then broke down to the 1.20 area. 1.19 offers support, where the pair can find buyers and clear the 1.21 level.
The GBPUSD didn’t do a lot, which is a sign that it is trying to break out. 1.365 offers resistance, if we break above, the pair will aim higher. 1.3333 is supportive underneath.
The USDJPY did a lot of back and forth move during Monday, but couldn’t clear 113.5. Expect pull backs, which will offer good entry points, the pair eventually will break out on top! 112 is kind of an absolut floor.

7p5xrq,1515488773,aapl,SPECTACULAR NUMBERS,"Watching Wall Street boast its best start to a year in over a decade, investors are turning their focus to the fourth quarter earnings season, with results beginning to trickle in this week. Traders are focusing on the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which could provide breathtaking numbers, but  it will not affect stock prices much.


**ECONOMIES**

German factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slipped by 0.4% in November after three months of gains. The dip was largely due to fluctuations in bulk orders but the overall trend remains positive. 
China's forex reserves posted an eleventh straight monthly increase in December, $20.7B, taking the full-year increase of the world's largest foreign-currency stockpile to $129B.

The FED should raise interest rates three times this year, given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts.


**ARAMCO’s 5% IS FOR SALE**

Aligning its strategy with peers, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), CEO Ben van Beurden said that growth of competitor Shell's (RDS.A) oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production. On what else?! Candies? What a discovery!
Saudi Aramco and some of the kingdom's biggest companies said they'll pay Saudi staff more money, matching a royal order amid rising prices. Saudi Arabia seeks to sell as much as 5% of Aramco.


**CRYPTO**

The SEC has received a request to allow five bitcoin-related ETFs to be listed on Arca, a secondary marketplace on the NYSE. The instruments, are not tied to the price of the cryptocurrency itself, but would track bitcoin futures.


**AT&amp;T BACKS DOWN**

AT&amp;T (T) is backing away from a plan to sell phones made by Chinese handset giant Huawei, on the eve of a big announcement of the deal. The deal that Huawei was set to announce tomorrow would have been its first partnership with a major U.S. carrier, but AT&amp;T has changed its mind. So far it is not clear why AT&amp;T backed down, but there are two issues occur. Are Huawei's phones carry spyware? Is it because the US wants to have domestic competition? At one point we’ll have the answer.


**THERE ARE NO JEDIS IN CHINA**

$36 million in third-week grosses, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Sony) finally toppled Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney) from the top of the box-office charts. Disney made an impressive $1.2 billion, but it is far from the estimated $2 billion. It seems that China has no Jedis, the movie made only 26% of expectations in the country. The Force is weak in China.


**NVIDIA, VOLKSWAGEN, UBER, AI**

Making further gains in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nvidia (NVDA) is partnering with Uber and Volkswagen on AI platforms. So far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers, or sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, proven that there is more than cryptomining to the company!


**WHIRLPOOL KICKS OFF CES2018**

Apple (AAPL) Watch users will soon have the ability to control Whirlpool (WHR) appliances through the wearable. Whirlpool announced the development at CES and said the compatibility would come later this year to 20 connected appliances.  Whirlpool says Amazon (AMZN) Alexa and Google (GOOGC) Assistant voice controls will also arrive in 2018.


**SPACEX - THE FIRST LAUNCH OF 2018**

SpaceX successfully launched a secret U.S. government payload called Zuma on Sunday and landed its rocket back on Earth. The Falcon 9 powered a spacecraft made by Northrop Grumman, which was sent into low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is now looking towards its next challenge, launching the Falcon Heavy - its largest rocket to date - at the end of January, meanwhile Tesla’s stock price soared higher.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Amazon (AMZN)** Alexa Onboard was introduced yesterday. Another green day.

**Electronic Arts (EA)** is upgraded to Buy, new PT is $130.

**Applied Materials (AMAT)** also got an upgrade, double bottom formed, ready to rock!

**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** had great presentation at JPM Healthcare conference. Climbing steady.

**PayPal (PYPL)** one day transfer, instant debit card transfer. Smells like blockchain integration. But who cares?! $86 on the way. Tight stop people!


**FX WORLD**

Not a lot happened on Monday, mostly momentum trading was possible. It doesn’t seem to be busy today either, still look for the correct entry points!
The EURUSD initially took off to the upside, then broke down to the 1.20 area. 1.19 offers support, where the pair can find buyers and clear the 1.21 level.
The GBPUSD didn’t do a lot, which is a sign that it is trying to break out. 1.365 offers resistance, if we break above, the pair will aim higher. 1.3333 is supportive underneath.
The USDJPY did a lot of back and forth move during Monday, but couldn’t clear 113.5. Expect pull backs, which will offer good entry points, the pair eventually will break out on top! 112 is kind of an absolut floor.

7p6ngl,1515499259,nvda,SPECTACULAR NUMBERS,"Watching Wall Street boast its best start to a year in over a decade, investors are turning their focus to the fourth quarter earnings season, with results beginning to trickle in this week. Traders are focusing on the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which could provide breathtaking numbers, but  it will not affect stock prices much.


**ECONOMIES**

German factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slipped by 0.4% in November after three months of gains. The dip was largely due to fluctuations in bulk orders but the overall trend remains positive. 
China's forex reserves posted an eleventh straight monthly increase in December, $20.7B, taking the full-year increase of the world's largest foreign-currency stockpile to $129B.

The FED should raise interest rates three times this year, given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts.


**ARAMCO’s 5% IS FOR SALE**

Aligning its strategy with peers, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), CEO Ben van Beurden said that growth of competitor Shell's (RDS.A) oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production. On what else?! Candies? What a discovery!
Saudi Aramco and some of the kingdom's biggest companies said they'll pay Saudi staff more money, matching a royal order amid rising prices. Saudi Arabia seeks to sell as much as 5% of Aramco.


**CRYPTO**

The SEC has received a request to allow five bitcoin-related ETFs to be listed on Arca, a secondary marketplace on the NYSE. The instruments, are not tied to the price of the cryptocurrency itself, but would track bitcoin futures.


**AT&amp;T BACKS DOWN**

AT&amp;T (T) is backing away from a plan to sell phones made by Chinese handset giant Huawei, on the eve of a big announcement of the deal. The deal that Huawei was set to announce tomorrow would have been its first partnership with a major U.S. carrier, but AT&amp;T has changed its mind. So far it is not clear why AT&amp;T backed down, but there are two issues occur. Are Huawei's phones carry spyware? Is it because the US wants to have domestic competition? At one point we’ll have the answer.


**THERE ARE NO JEDIS IN CHINA**

$36 million in third-week grosses, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Sony) finally toppled Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney) from the top of the box-office charts. Disney made an impressive $1.2 billion, but it is far from the estimated $2 billion. It seems that China has no Jedis, the movie made only 26% of expectations in the country. The Force is weak in China.


**NVIDIA, VOLKSWAGEN, UBER, AI**

Making further gains in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nvidia (NVDA) is partnering with Uber and Volkswagen on AI platforms. So far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers, or sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, proven that there is more than cryptomining to the company!


**WHIRLPOOL KICKS OFF CES2018**

Apple (AAPL) Watch users will soon have the ability to control Whirlpool (WHR) appliances through the wearable. Whirlpool announced the development at CES and said the compatibility would come later this year to 20 connected appliances.  Whirlpool says Amazon (AMZN) Alexa and Google (GOOGC) Assistant voice controls will also arrive in 2018.


**SPACEX - THE FIRST LAUNCH OF 2018**

SpaceX successfully launched a secret U.S. government payload called Zuma on Sunday and landed its rocket back on Earth. The Falcon 9 powered a spacecraft made by Northrop Grumman, which was sent into low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is now looking towards its next challenge, launching the Falcon Heavy - its largest rocket to date - at the end of January, meanwhile Tesla’s stock price soared higher.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Amazon (AMZN)** Alexa Onboard was introduced yesterday. Another green day.

**Electronic Arts (EA)** is upgraded to Buy, new PT is $130.

**Applied Materials (AMAT)** also got an upgrade, double bottom formed, ready to rock!

**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** had great presentation at JPM Healthcare conference. Climbing steady.

**PayPal (PYPL)** one day transfer, instant debit card transfer. Smells like blockchain integration. But who cares?! $86 on the way. Tight stop people!


**FX WORLD**

Not a lot happened on Monday, mostly momentum trading was possible. It doesn’t seem to be busy today either, still look for the correct entry points!
The EURUSD initially took off to the upside, then broke down to the 1.20 area. 1.19 offers support, where the pair can find buyers and clear the 1.21 level.
The GBPUSD didn’t do a lot, which is a sign that it is trying to break out. 1.365 offers resistance, if we break above, the pair will aim higher. 1.3333 is supportive underneath.
The USDJPY did a lot of back and forth move during Monday, but couldn’t clear 113.5. Expect pull backs, which will offer good entry points, the pair eventually will break out on top! 112 is kind of an absolut floor.

The EURUSD initially took off to the upside, then broke down to the 1.20 area. 1.19 offers support, where the pair can find buyers and clear the 1.21 level.
The GBPUSD didn’t do a lot, which is a sign that it is trying to break out. 1.365 offers resistance, if we break above, the pair will aim higher. 1.3333 is supportive underneath.
The USDJPY did a lot of back and forth move during Monday, but couldn’t clear 113.5. Expect pull backs, which will offer good entry points, the pair eventually will break out on top! 112 is kind of an absolut floor.

7p6v5e,1515502025,aapl,SPECTACULAR NUMBERS,"Watching Wall Street boast its best start to a year in over a decade, investors are turning their focus to the fourth quarter earnings season, with results beginning to trickle in this week. Traders are focusing on the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which could provide breathtaking numbers, but  it will not affect stock prices much.


**ECONOMIES**

German factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slipped by 0.4% in November after three months of gains. The dip was largely due to fluctuations in bulk orders but the overall trend remains positive. 
China's forex reserves posted an eleventh straight monthly increase in December, $20.7B, taking the full-year increase of the world's largest foreign-currency stockpile to $129B.

The FED should raise interest rates three times this year, given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts.


**ARAMCO’s 5% IS FOR SALE**

Aligning its strategy with peers, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), CEO Ben van Beurden said that growth of competitor Shell's (RDS.A) oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production. On what else?! Candies? What a discovery!
Saudi Aramco and some of the kingdom's biggest companies said they'll pay Saudi staff more money, matching a royal order amid rising prices. Saudi Arabia seeks to sell as much as 5% of Aramco.


**CRYPTO**

The SEC has received a request to allow five bitcoin-related ETFs to be listed on Arca, a secondary marketplace on the NYSE. The instruments, are not tied to the price of the cryptocurrency itself, but would track bitcoin futures.


**AT&amp;T BACKS DOWN**

AT&amp;T (T) is backing away from a plan to sell phones made by Chinese handset giant Huawei, on the eve of a big announcement of the deal. The deal that Huawei was set to announce tomorrow would have been its first partnership with a major U.S. carrier, but AT&amp;T has changed its mind. So far it is not clear why AT&amp;T backed down, but there are two issues occur. Are Huawei's phones carry spyware? Is it because the US wants to have domestic competition? At one point we’ll have the answer.


**THERE ARE NO JEDIS IN CHINA**

$36 million in third-week grosses, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Sony) finally toppled Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney) from the top of the box-office charts. Disney made an impressive $1.2 billion, but it is far from the estimated $2 billion. It seems that China has no Jedis, the movie made only 26% of expectations in the country. The Force is weak in China.


**NVIDIA, VOLKSWAGEN, UBER, AI**

Making further gains in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nvidia (NVDA) is partnering with Uber and Volkswagen on AI platforms. So far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers, or sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, proven that there is more than cryptomining to the company!


**WHIRLPOOL KICKS OFF CES2018**

Apple (AAPL) Watch users will soon have the ability to control Whirlpool (WHR) appliances through the wearable. Whirlpool announced the development at CES and said the compatibility would come later this year to 20 connected appliances.  Whirlpool says Amazon (AMZN) Alexa and Google (GOOGC) Assistant voice controls will also arrive in 2018.


**SPACEX - THE FIRST LAUNCH OF 2018**

SpaceX successfully launched a secret U.S. government payload called Zuma on Sunday and landed its rocket back on Earth. The Falcon 9 powered a spacecraft made by Northrop Grumman, which was sent into low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is now looking towards its next challenge, launching the Falcon Heavy - its largest rocket to date - at the end of January, meanwhile Tesla’s stock price soared higher.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Amazon (AMZN)** Alexa Onboard was introduced yesterday. Another green day.

**Electronic Arts (EA)** is upgraded to Buy, new PT is $130.

**Applied Materials (AMAT)** also got an upgrade, double bottom formed, ready to rock!

**PayPal (PYPL)** one day transfer, instant debit card transfer. Smells like blockchain integration. But who cares?! $86 on the way. Tight stop people!

7p6xiy,1515502850,aapl,Morning report,"The International Consumer Electronics Show, known universally as CES, kicks off today as startups and the biggest names in the industry descend on Las Vegas. The event featuring 4,000 exhibitors stretches over four days, offering its 170K attendees a glimpse into the future. Notable showcases: Augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, tech wearables, 3D printing, self-driving cars and ""Internet of Things"" products.

Economy

Federal energy regulators have killed Rick Perry's power grid proposal, which would have subsidized some coal and nuclear power plants. According to the FERC, the plan failed to show that current electricity markets are not just or reasonable, or may be a threat to grid resilience. The rejection is a major victory for natural gas, wind, solar and other clean industries.

The U.S. federal board managing Puerto Rico's finances will consider fast-tracking four energy projects that would invest a combined $1.47B - almost all of which will be private capital - in the island's decimated power grid. Final decisions will come by early April. Much of the territory still remains without power almost four months after Hurricane Maria struck the island on Sept. 20.

Goldman Sachs believes the dollar is set for another ""soggy"" year despite a hawkish Fed that could hike interest rates up to four times in the next twelve months. We are now in a ""fairly synchronized global upswing,"" according to the firm, where other central banks are also looking to push benchmark rates higher, diminishing the appeal of higher-yielding assets in the U.S.

President Trump is close to making a decision on who to nominate as vice chair of the Federal Reserve after Stanley Fischer stepped down from the No. 2 position in October. The nomination will be part of a wider leadership shakeup at the central bank after Trump picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen, when her term ends as chair next month.

It's been more than two years since the last official face-to-face talks between North and South Korea, but the two sides managed to get together today to discuss next month's Winter Olympics. As the meeting progressed, South Korea voiced a desire to discuss the North's nuclear program, but the latter's representatives didn't show a clear response to the request, said Chun Haesung, a member of Seoul's delegation.

China's central bank has made a change to the regime used to manage the yuan, removing the volatility-reducing ""counter-cyclical factor"" it introduced last year, sources told Bloomberg. The move will increase the role of markets in setting the daily fix for the yuan, which headed for its biggest drop in two months on the news.

Stocks

Samsung Electronics expects fourth-quarter operating profit to be its highest ever, up 64% Y/Y to 15.1T won ($14.1B), although the figure still fell short of analyst forecasts, pushing shares down 3% in South Korea. The results come amid a leadership vacuum at the top of the company. Its chairman is incapacitated, de facto leader Lee Jae-yong is in prison and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) replaced all three of its co-CEOs in late October.

According to founder Jack Ma, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will ""seriously consider"" a listing in Hong Kong, responding to an invitation from the financial hub's leader asking the company to do so. Alibaba held its record $25B public float in New York in 2014 after Hong Kong refused to accept its governance structure, but recent changes now allow the territory to permit dual-class shares.

Facebook's Oculus is partnering with Xiaomi (Private:XI) on its new standalone virtual reality headset, the Oculus Go, which is expected to ship early this year. The company further revealed it will launch a version of the product exclusively for the Chinese market called ""Mi VR Standalone."" Oculus (NASDAQ:FB) also intends to work closely with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), using Snapdragon 821 chipsets to power the VR headsets.

GoPro would be willing to partner with a larger sector player but is not actively engaged in a sale. The news caused shares to partly rebound from heavy losses on Monday after the company cut 20% of its workforce, exited the drone market and slashed its Q4 revenue forecast. ""If the right opportunity presented itself, it's something we would consider,"" GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) said in a statement.

Eleven men were charged in a Singapore court today in connection with a large-scale oil theft at Shell's biggest refinery (RDS.A, RDS.B), while police said they were investigating six other men arrested in a weekend raid. Millions of dollars in cash have been seized, as well as a small tanker, during the proceedings into the heist at the Pulau Bukom industrial site.

The SEC continues to crack down on cryptocurrency trading, halting shares of UBI Blockchain Internet (OTCPK:UBIA) through Jan. 22. The regulator cited potentially inaccurate disclosures and unusual market activity. The stock spiked to $87 on Dec. 18 from just $9 on Dec. 11 and has since fallen back to $22.

Altice NV has approved plans to separate Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS) from the telecoms and cable group, simplifying a sprawling communications empire that encompassed two distinct markets. Altice NV (OTCPK:ATCEY), which will be renamed as Altice Europe, aims to complete the deal by the end of the second quarter in 2018. ATUS +2% premarket.

On the eve of the big announcement, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) backed away from a plan to sell phones made by Huawei, which would have been its first partnership with a major U.S. carrier, WSJ reports. While it's not clear why, a 2012 congressional report raised concerns about state-sponsored spying via telecommunications equipment made by the Chinese handset giant.

Alexa gets behind the wheel... Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has introduced Alexa Onboard technology, which lets users access the voice assistant through their car's infotainment system. That means drivers or passengers can play music, ask for directions or get other information simply by speaking aloud.

Former Google engineer, James Damore, fired after he asserted in a memo that biological causes were behind tech industry gender inequality, has sued his ex-employer for being discriminated against as a white male with conservative political views. A separate case filed by three women who used to work at Google (GOOG, GOOGL), alleging it pays women less than men for comparable work, was dismissed last month, but has been refiled in an amended form.

Apple is planning new features to help parents control how kids use its smartphones, looking to ""add functionality and make [current] tools even more robust,"" a spokeswoman said late Monday. It's a response to criticism from two major shareholders - JANA Partners and CalSTRS - that said iPhone overuse could be hurting children's developing brains, an issue that may harm Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term market value.

Following last week's disclosure of massive security vulnerabilities, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said it will form a new cybersecurity group and expects to issue processor updates by the end of January. The company also showcased its first self-driving test car at CES, announcing a number of automaker tie-ups and stating Mobileye's autonomous tech will be used in 2M vehicles.

A highly classified U.S. spy satellite is presumed to be a total loss after it failed to reach orbit atop a SpaceX (Private:SPACE) rocket on Sunday, WSJ reports. The payload, code-named Zuma and built by Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), was estimated to carry a price tag in the billions of dollars. The failure comes as SpaceX competes for more national-security launches against rival United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

So far it is not clear why AT&amp;T backed down, but there are two issues occur. Are Huawei's phones carry spyware? Is it because the US wants to have domestic competition? At one point we’ll have the answer.


**THERE ARE NO JEDIS IN CHINA**

$36 million in third-week grosses, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Sony) finally toppled Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Disney) from the top of the box-office charts. Disney made an impressive $1.2 billion, but it is far from the estimated $2 billion. It seems that China has no Jedis, the movie made only 26% of expectations in the country. The Force is weak in China.


**NVIDIA, VOLKSWAGEN, UBER, AI**

Making further gains in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nvidia (NVDA) is partnering with Uber and Volkswagen on AI platforms. So far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers, or sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, proven that there is more than cryptomining to the company!


**WHIRLPOOL KICKS OFF CES2018**

Apple (AAPL) Watch users will soon have the ability to control Whirlpool (WHR) appliances through the wearable. Whirlpool announced the development at CES and said the compatibility would come later this year to 20 connected appliances.  Whirlpool says Amazon (AMZN) Alexa and Google (GOOGC) Assistant voice controls will also arrive in 2018.


**SPACEX - THE FIRST LAUNCH OF 2018**

SpaceX successfully launched a secret U.S. government payload called Zuma on Sunday and landed its rocket back on Earth. The Falcon 9 powered a spacecraft made by Northrop Grumman, which was sent into low-Earth orbit. SpaceX is now looking towards its next challenge, launching the Falcon Heavy - its largest rocket to date - at the end of January, meanwhile Tesla’s stock price soared higher.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Amazon (AMZN)** Alexa Onboard was introduced yesterday. Another green day.

**Electronic Arts (EA)** is upgraded to Buy, new PT is $130.

**Applied Materials (AMAT)** also got an upgrade, double bottom formed, ready to rock!

**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)** had great presentation at JPM Healthcare conference. Climbing steady.

**PayPal (PYPL)** one day transfer, instant debit card transfer. Smells like blockchain integration. But who cares?! $86 on the way. Tight stop people!


**FX WORLD**

Not a lot happened on Monday, mostly momentum trading was possible. It doesn’t seem to be busy today either, still look for the correct entry points!
The EURUSD initially took off to the upside, then broke down to the 1.20 area. 1.19 offers support, where the pair can find buyers and clear the 1.21 level.
The GBPUSD didn’t do a lot, which is a sign that it is trying to break out. 1.365 offers resistance, if we break above, the pair will aim higher. 1.3333 is supportive underneath.
The USDJPY did a lot of back and forth move during Monday, but couldn’t clear 113.5. Expect pull backs, which will offer good entry points, the pair eventually will break out on top! 112 is kind of an absolut floor.

7p73fn,1515504697,aapl,SPECTACULAR NUMBERS,"Watching Wall Street boast its best start to a year in over a decade, investors are turning their focus to the fourth quarter earnings season, with results beginning to trickle in this week. Traders are focusing on the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which could provide breathtaking numbers, but  it will not affect stock prices much.


**ECONOMIES**

German factory orders in Europe's biggest economy slipped by 0.4% in November after three months of gains. The dip was largely due to fluctuations in bulk orders but the overall trend remains positive. 
China's forex reserves posted an eleventh straight monthly increase in December, $20.7B, taking the full-year increase of the world's largest foreign-currency stockpile to $129B.

The FED should raise interest rates three times this year, given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts.


**ARAMCO’s 5% IS FOR SALE**

Aligning its strategy with peers, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), CEO Ben van Beurden said that growth of competitor Shell's (RDS.A) oil and gas operations in the next decade will depend on shale production. On what else?! Candies? What a discovery!
Saudi Aramco and some of the kingdom's biggest companies said they'll pay Saudi staff more money, matching a royal order amid rising prices. Saudi Arabia seeks to sell as much as 5% of Aramco.


**CRYPTO**

The SEC has received a request to allow five bitcoin-related ETFs to be listed on Arca, a secondary marketplace on the NYSE. The instruments, are not tied to the price of the cryptocurrency itself, but would track bitcoin futures.


**AT&amp;T BACKS DOWN**

AT&amp;T (T) is backing away from a plan to sell phones made by Chinese handset giant Huawei, on the eve of a big announcement of the deal.

7p74la,1515505072,nvda,Sell BTC and transfer to robinhood?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been using Robinhood for a few weeks now and I’ve managed to be up about 8% in my portfolio thanks to nvda and mjx mostly. I have about $2000 worth of bitcoin + BTC from a purchase I made about 4 years ago (bought .10 of a bitcoin when it was around $500 a coin). But I feel like this crypto bubble is gonna burst.

Do you think it’s a good idea to sell off my $2k and transfer it to Robinhood to increase my portfolio? Sell half of it? ",1

For some context I am on company 401k+match and separate Fidelity Roth IRA, both of which I (try) to maximize every year. Medical issues have been preventing that for me last 2 years but i'm getting better.

I am fully aware that this forum isn't professional financial advice per se, but I know many of you are experts in your own right. Please evaluate my early holdings and tell me if you don't mind where I could be lacking or lopsided volatility wise. As far as I know most all of my holdings are low volatility--I have a few solids like FB, Apple, etc. and a few ETFs. I do also have several lower priced stocks that could i suppose be categorized as more volatile. 

What i'm going for is solid year to year growth with a dash of risk, assuming the latter isn't reckless abandon and is only initiated through much research. I've been told i'm too tech heavy at the moment by one person--not sure how accurate that is.

I bought into VGT and got something I didn't get with other stocks like T, ALK and NVDA: a prospectus. Robinhood sent it to me in email a day after my purchase.

I guess my question is what's the deal with these things? I know what they are but why doesn't every stock issue a prospectus for every order? Is it just for ETFs or should I be getting a prospectus for every trade I've made via Robinhood?

Edit: I trade mainly in IT, not sure if industry has anything to do with me not getting more of these things.",1
7pahs6,1515533858,gme,How much capitol is too little?,"Hey everyone, absolute clueless idiot here. Last week I opened up an RH account and put in $50 to get my feet wet with trading stocks, the market in general, looking at graphs, etc. So far its been insanely fun and rewarding (managing a return on my investments I've picked on gut feeling). However I feel like playing around with only 50$ is giving me limited exposure. Do you think it would be worthwhile to put in more capitol? This money is 100% liquid and I wouldnt be upset if I managed to lose it all. I want to begin learning how to do stock analysis etc instead of just picking companies I know of and trust in. However, I currently can only buy maybe a few stocks at the most. Thanks for any input!

Also I'm holding $AMD, $GME, and a tiny company called $TMQ",1
7paixp,1515534122,msft,End of day summary - 01/09,"The Dow rose 102.80, or 0.41%, to 25,385.80, the Nasdaq gained 6.19, or 0.09%, to 7,163.58, and the S&amp;P 500 advanced 3.58, or 0.13%, to 2,751.29.

---

All main stock benchmarks closed at records on Tuesday with the S&amp;P 500 notching six consecutive records to kick off a new year, something it has not done since 1964. Two of the S&amp;P 500's heaviest sectors--health care and financials--led the charge on Tuesday, bouncing back from a disappointing showing on Monday. 

The financial sector rallied 0.7% amid a steepening of the yield curve, which translates to an increase in the spread between what lenders charge on loans and what they pay on deposits. The yield on the benchmark 10-yr Treasury note jumped to 2.55% after settling Monday at 2.48% while the 2-yr yield finished flat at 1.96%.

The industrial sector finished just a step below health care and financials at the top of the sector standings with a gain of 0.6%. BA  jumped 2.7% to a new record high, helping give the Dow an edge over the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq; **Boeing is the priciest, and therefore the most influential, component in the price-weighted Dow.**

The consumer discretionary sector (+0.1%) also finished in the green, but the seven remaining groups settled in the red. The top-weighted technology space lost 0.3% with semiconductor giant INTC  losing 2.5%. INTC shares extended early losses after MSFT said fixes for Intel chip vulnerabilities--which were reported last week--could significantly slow certain servers and personal computers.

Retailers struggled in general, trimming gains from a two-month run, but TGT had a positive outing after raising its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. TGT shares added 2.9% while the **XRT  declined 1.1%**.

Among the notable gainers was GBT, which jumped 19% after the company announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Also higher was ABAX, which gained 16% after the company reported preliminary results for the third quarter that were better than expected. **KODK doubled after boarding the blockchain bandwagon**. “We are using Ethereum Smart Contracts, but we’re also developing our own proprietary blockchain and will evaluate the optimal solution during development,” Kodak said in a statement.

Among the noteworthy losers following their pre-announcements of quarterly results were EXPR, which slid 20%, ELF, which fell 11%, and URBN, which dropped 4%.

7panav,1515535115,nvda,Long term Options strategy,"I would like to hold positions in some stocks i believe will do long term, nvda, sq, goog, etc. 

But i am unsure what is the best way to hold virtual longstock using options.

1. Buy deep in the money 70-80 Delta Call with 150-180 dte and Sell a 20-30 Delta Put with 50 dte to have 100 Delta. 

2. Long Call (150-180 dte) + Short Put (50 dte), both ATM 

3. Long Call 30 Delta (150-180 dte) + Short Put (50 dte) Deep in money 70 Delta.

What would u suggest is the most balanced strategy to hold virtual long stock using options for long term investment perspective ?",1
7parai,1515535993,msft,Finally asking the experts - PC hardware or software KVM - PC,"Hi folks- I've been noodling unsuccessfully about this for over a year and have been doing it what I'm fairly certain is the hard way. I have:

Desktop PC (personal)
Laptop PC (work)
Bluetooth &lt;MSFT&gt; keyboard (with BT dongle)
Bluetooth &lt;Logitech&gt; mouse (with BT dongle)

Both that I use in my home office. I have two monitors, which I like to use with both machines. Currently, when I want to switch between the two, I:

Change the input with a soft button on both monitors
Swap the dongles for both input devices to usb inputs on each machine

It works, but is inefficient. A traditional KVM doesn't do the trick due to the multiple input devices (and brands).

In a perfect world, I'd be able to simply hit a couple of buttons and have use of both screens and inputs for whichever computer I want to work with.

Thoughts? And many thanks in advance.",0

What is holding a stock like MU back so much in such a bullish market. Considering the last earnings beat, the price and the fact that others like NVDA are so much higher priced and continue to climb.

I am looking for answers that would help me understand for future reference and be able to make better decision. ",0

Atypically of me, I resisted the temptation long enough to get my few other items and check out before I fully relented to the 'f*ck it' voice. I immediately walked to the nearby McDonalds and stuffed my face with greasy food. As gross as I feel about having a stomach full of McD's, I am infinitely thankful I did not buy beer tonight. Hope everyone is having a good night. I won't drink with you today.",1
7plpqg,1515645979,mcd,[Request] How much money would I save per annum if I eat only home cooked food,"So I wanted to know how much money would i save if I eat only food cooked st home, I'd buy the fruits and raw stuff from market and cook them at home. No street food, no coffee from outside, no McD or anything.

Make all the necessary assumptions like if I eat thrice a day plus some extra snacks sometimes (again, snacks are home made, no packed or canned or frozen stuff either)

I'm only allowed to buy raw material from outside.",1
7pngq4,1515669894,gme,Something about Frost Lich Jaina,"I've played this gme for 3 years.
I found that Frost Lich Jaina is too weak now
because it do nothing with your survival(compared with Shadowreaper),do nothing with your minions(compared with Blood Guldan).And killing a minion with your hero skill is too hard. Most of times ,using this card is just cost 9 mana to gain 5 armor and a 4 mana cost minion.

So i think maybe Frost Lich Jaina needs a buff
In my opinion, maybe we can gain one mana cost of it and add a new function, freeze all the minions except for elements or maybe change the hero skill into deal two damage summon an water element when you kill the minion.

I hope these will be seen by the game designer XD
And also, I'm not a native speaker, sorry if i made some mistakes

That time I was ""sure"" I would stick to a healthy eating and exercise routine. Stereotypically for me, some sort of vacation/event/drama came up which gave me the excuse to go off of my new healthy lifestyle and indulge. That indulgence would then lead to 3 months of binging and lots of couch sitting. Then my resolve would come around again...the number of the scale would be scary...my clothes would be uncomfortable...going up the stairs quickly would wind me more than I'd like...and back on the merry go round we went.

So...dare I say, here we go again? This time is a little different. My ""off the wagon"" wasn't completely a derailed train wreck. I've been working out and not eating complete garbage on and off since June. I'm down 19 pounds and probably a clothing size and a half. I wasn't counting calories but I was eating more vegetables and not eating McD's 4 nights a week and ordering Chinese take out on the weekends. So my starting off point is not my ""bottom"" if you will.

But regardless...it's time and I'm focused. This time my commitment is openly discussed with people I care about and who care about me. I have written down goals and put them in places where I can see them. I have chosen an macro profile that I can be satisfied and look forward to consuming. I have had an unhealthy relationship with food that I will need to work on, but I think I'm headed in the right direction.

Currently I am 185 lbs. My highest weight was 204 lbs...admittedly I think I saw that on a scale after a day of garbage eating and fairly dehydrated...so it may be an exaggeration. But I have seen 199 on a scale, butt naked, at 6:30am, after a trip to the bathroom. It was an extremely unpleasant moment and one I hope to never experience again.

My macros are &lt;20g net Carb | 116 g Fat | 83 g Pro with a regular strength and cardio routine.

I will adjust as necessary...but this is the course I've set for now.

7pqi3m,1515698350,msft,My Adventure with 3+ Surface Pro 4s,"This may sound like another hardware complain post, but I want to post this to make new buyers aware.

So, I inherited my first surface from my dad. After over a year of using his Surface pro 4 (i7,16gb), he decided to upgrade to a new one and gave me his. It was having an issue which I have traced down to an issue within Intel Integrated Graphics. This issue causes the screen to shake and glitch out whenever the Intel chip reaches a certain threshold. I did what any reasonable owner does and went back to the store and worked with Microsoft on it. They saw the issue, I showed them how to replicate it, and even though it was outside of the default warranty, they would replace it for under 200$. I agreed and paid the money. That day I walked out with a new, refurbished Surface Pro 4 (i7, 16gb). I enjoyed working with Microsoft on the issue as they quickly responded and discounted the replacement.

A few months go by and a new issue appears. I am sitting at my desk, preparing to reformat my surface and clean it up for a new semester. I backup all my files and reboot the computer. The computer doesn't reboot. After 2 hours of troubleshooting I reach the bios page and see notifications that the problem is an SSD Failure. So here I am with two questions: 1) This surface has broken twice in about 4-5 months, WTF? and 2) SSD Failures usually don't occur until the disk has been used an insane amount, why is this happening now?

I called MSFT support, tell them what happened. They go through some troubleshooting steps, check my warranty, and quote me 400$ for a replacement by mail. Instead of mailing it off, I go to my local MSFT store and replicate the problem for them. I tell the staff that the device has an SSD Failure, load to bios, show them the indicator. The employee then replaces my surface on the spot free of charge. This is amazing customer service, but I am still sitting there like WTF, it has broken TWICE in only a few months.

This new, refurbished surface has been working well, except for the fact that there is now a quarter-sized discoloration in the screen. I am probably going to go to the store again, but I am really getting tired of replacing my laptop. Why is it that I have to replace it every few months? Is MSFT Quality control this bad? At this pace, I am VERY tempted to try and sell this surface (which I LOVE when it is working) and buy something like a MacBook Pro (not the new thunderbolt 3 ones) as they don't have to be replaced every 3 months...

Am I the oddball or is this a common situation for Surface owners?

TLDR: Surface broke, paid for a replacement, surface broke, traded in for a replacement, surface screen discolored, TEMPTED TO REPLACE FOR A THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS.

7pqn9j,1515699519,mcd,[Update] Inspiration and motivation after 365 days.,"I came to keto after my wife and I started seeing a new family physician.  I’m not going to use this space to get into the ‘how’ very much.  I’m writing this in hopes that I can inspire some n00bs that it’s worth it to commit to this way of living.  A year ago I was the keto n00b.   I was struggling (not just health/weight). I found the help and guidance I needed in this community and I hope others may do the same. 

So here we go.  We went in to see the new physician for an initial visit and consultation.  Same old same.  Get weighed, blood pressure, check out the nose and ears, doctor ask if you have any health concerns.  

This time it was different.  My doctor started by asking me a startling question.  “What are your fitness goals, and where do you want to be in terms of physical ability the future?” Basically, where do you see yourself if you maintain your lifestyle as-is.    I had just tipped the scales at 270.1 lbs.  That’s damn near 20 Stone… Fuck…. I asked the doctor for some clarification.  I mean, I thought I was pretty active. I played ice hockey 1-2 times a week and participated in a work sponsored fitness boot camp for about a year.  What could she mean?  “How active do you want to be, you know, play with your daughter without being physically exhausted”.  

Then it hit me, the doctor, whom I had literally just met was concerned.  The visit concluded after some back and forth along the lines of ‘yeah, I’ll do better…. See ya next year’… My wife and I proceeded to the nearest McD’s Large fries, large coke, 20-pc nuggets.  That was my order.  

As I was playing with my daughter on the floor of our house, out of breath, struggling to get back to my feet I came to the realization that I needed to make a change.  Not just for me, but more for her.  I didn’t want to be heart-attack dad at a super young age like my grandfather (35).  I didn’t want to struggle to tie my shoes.  I didn’t want to worry about breaking the wooden staircase in my house.  I mean, what happened to me?   Diet..  Everything, er.. the majority and quantity of what I ate was, as I believe it, killing me.  I decided on January 11, 2017 things were going to change.  With no preparation, and flying by the seat of my pants, I was going keto as I understood it then. 

 January 12, 2017. I woke up early for work to make a solid keto breakfast.  Scrambled eggs with cheese and a whole can of black beans (oops).  I got to work that morning and started to google low-carb recipes, and eventually found my way shortly thereafter to this community.   As I started to browse the thread, read the FAQ, and really digest everyone’s stories I decided that I can do this.  Everyone here IS doing this.  Why not me, right?  I started very strict, just as I had done with paleo, but after a month it was just different.  I was no longer craving donuts, ice cream, bread, beans.  I was full.   Total weight loss after 1 month – 25 lbs.  

I’m hooked!  

Every day as I watched the scale move lower and lower it was a little victory.  It truly made me believe that I can change and maintain those changes.  Again, people just like me on r/keto are doing it, why not me?  Total weight loss after 2 months – 39 lbs.  

So, two months had elapsed and I wasn’t getting sick of eating this way.  I loved it.  It seemed like there was endless variety of foods that I loved.  Getting sick of chicken?  Sure, lets switch to baked salmon and broccoli.  Not feeling bacon today?  Better have a steak.  How does one not love those options?  

A few months had elapsed and the weight loss continued.  I gradually started incorporating some jogging in addition to skating.  Still loving the food, still loving the progress; albeit slower as time went on.  I guess another point I’m trying to make is that this is not burning me out.  You have some guidelines and you basically keep it between the ditches, so to speak.  Yes, there have been hard days.  Yes, there have been donuts.  However, tomorrow is a new day.  Every second that ticks by is a chance for a new start.  Every problem that you experience is a learning opportunity.  This thread is and has been a virtual cornucopia of knowledge, experience, support, patience, understanding, and resources that have helped me stay committed.  I can’t honestly say that I don’t ever foresee myself getting off the keto train.  Nothing stops my keto train.  Choo choo, baby.  I realize everyone is different, but this is the approach that worked for me, and I’ve seen tremendous progress while following the guidelines set forth in this thread and drawn on the experiences of all contributors.  I hope that someone reads this and finds the motivation they need.  Hell, if this convinces just one person to try it.  I’ll take that as a win.  

One year later I’m a different person physically and mentally.  I’ve achieved things that I thought were unobtainable for me weight-wise.  It’s been worth it.  It is worth it.  
I have progress pics floating around. I’m not posting new ones for a while. 
To everyone that has commented on my posts, messaged me with inspiration, and given me advice.  Thank you.

Do you monitor their price within the day(or the week) before buying it, to try to snatch a good price? 

Or do you just market order it straight away as soon as you next login to your trading account?

Just curious on how people here execute the trade.",1

7ps3vd,1515711537,mcd,SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE-Mirror Update,"Hey there

Finally here it is. Very first update for MIND CONTROL DELETE!
Let’s get right to it and see what’s in store.

**Gameplay:**


* Four new levels (Desperados Bar, Lab, Office, Oil Rig)
If you’ve played SUPERHOT before you might recognise some of them.
They have been “refreshed” for MCD. We tweaked some covers, sprinkled it with new throwables and fixed spawning points. 
Also, on a side note, Oil rig is a level that some of you might recognise from SUPERHOT VR.
This fella went through a lot of redesigning. From endless level through VR to finally finishing in MCD where it should be. There is a different ""feel"" about him but you have to check it out yourself.


* Keybinds
Finally you will be able to change controls to suit your fancy playstyle habits.
All those AZERTY keyboards are screaming. 

* Smaller collider on player’s head
This one was actually pretty annoying for a lot of people. You will be able to dodge bullets in a more efficient manner now. No unexpected headshots for you.
 
Remaining changes for gameplay:

* Changed slomotion jumping tip
* HUD tweaks (changed recall katana skill icon)
* Added more customization options in graphics settings

**Bug Fixes:**

*“To err is human, to persist in error is diabolical.”*
Here is the rundown of bugs and errors we smushed.


* Player can no longer grab items through walls
* Level tweaks (bug fixes, new throwables)
* Fixed bug with changing the volume in settings
* Fixes to katana recall skill (katana bowling remains unchanged for now)
* Enemies can no longer kill you after the end of the level
* Audio fixes (defrag, esc sound, volumes)
* Other fixes to stuff you don't really care about but we do cause we love you.


That's it for this update but no worries we are not done for this month.
 Next up is  **Story Update** coming in late January.

Until that time:
stay healthy, stay safe and first and foremost stay tuned.

Love y'all
Szymon from SUPERHOT Team",1

7ptjpp,1515724957,msft,Your odds of winning are higher than you think,"In case you missed it, the bull market happened.  

Here's some guidance and peace of mind for the future though:

Major sectors for SP500: There are 8 of them 

* Technology
* Basic Materials
* Services
* Health Care
* Financial 
* Consumer Goods
* Industrial Goods
* Utilities 

Looking back in just the last year - If you went with the 3 largest companies from each sector (ignoring the micro sectors within each) that is approx 24 to 28  different stocks.

* Technology: GOOGL, MSFT, FB
* Basic Materials: XOM, CVX, SLB
* Services: AMZN, WMT, DIS/CMCSA,COST
* Health Care: JNJ, PFE,MRK
* Financial : JPM, WFC, BRK, BAC/C/V
* Consumer Goods: AAPL, KO/PEP/PG
* Industrial Goods: GE,MMM,HON/BA
* Utilities : NEE,DUK,D

Whatever your combination of these (all some, but at least 2/3).

Outcome: In a bull market, no major correction

1) You'd have a 80 to 92% win rate in selection. Your portfolio would be positive 73% of the time (44/60 months) .

2) On a 10K investment your total portfolio would be 24,000 (140% return)

3) Your max loss would be &lt;10%. However, as long as you can maintain this portfolio for a minimum of 2 years you'd still be positive.

4) Your average annual adjusted return is around 19%.

5) You'd beat the spy by about 15% or $3000.

Note: This does not include any major drawdowns that would come from a correction/black swan event. 

So how do you deal with a black swan event/or flash crash major correction?

1) You can retain 50% of your cash earning a GIC rate of 2% short term. This would give you a total return of around 70% not including dividends paid.  This will give you flexibility to average down and double your allocations.

2) You can maintain a trailing stop. Once you get stopped out, it is suggested you try to get back in as soon as possible. Your best bet to weather a crash is using a 10% draw down and a timeframe before you start re-allocating- give yourself either 6 months to one year before putting your money back in.

The downside of this, is you'd have commission costs- However you'd still earn more by doing this over the SPY.

7ptrzj,1515727234,msft,Divergence between net income and revenue growth,"Hey all, question for anyone experienced in fundamental analysis here. 

I'm working on fine tuning some algos that monitor company financials and I have one I've written which checks for divergences between net income growth and revenue growth. Basically right now if net income growth is less than 50% of revenue growth, or greater than 150% of revenue growth, the flag returns true. 

That said, if I use the average growth rate over a number of years the results are much more ... expected. But when I do it year by year, I find major companies like AMZN, AAPL, MSFT etc triggering this red flag because their net income is growing way faster than their sales. Here's [AMZN](https://i.imgur.com/5Bterlt.png) as an example. Specifically focusing on '15-'16 net income grew almost 300% but revenues only grew 27%. 

My questions are a) most importantly, if you saw this on a company would it raise a red flag for you and is it something you'd want to know about, or is my algo that's triggering it too sensitive? and b) anyone care to speculate on how that happened? 

Hopefully this isn't too all over the place. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!!

By the way, the growth figures that show -100% or +100% indicate that growth flipped signs (e.g. they went from -$10b net income to +$5b net income so it's difficult to quantify the growth rate), so I just default to -100% if it flipped positive to negative and to +100% if it flipped negative to positive. I know this is causing SOME inaccuracies in the divergence data but it's pretty obvious that the calculation is correct and I still find it odd that companies like MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, etc are triggering this flag.

Hey guys,

Not sure how active this sub is when I was going to Queen's I was completely lost and really had no idea what I was going to do after graduating. I would have loved the opportunity to talk to someone in the industry to see what it's like after graduation and how to go about job hunting. I didn't look very hard because I spent all my time playing StarCraft and LoL. If you're in CS, computer engineering, or ece and want to know more about the industry, write a post or pm me. While I didn't particularly enjoy my time at Queens, I know I had awful support from career services and I'm not sure how much better it got. 

I know someone currently in CS and from what she tells me most people don't believe they can get internships or jobs easily without top marks. That's categorically untrue because there is a huge labour shortage in the industry. I hope I can be of help in someway here.",-1

7pxv4v,1515775968,aapl,What would you sell?,"Hello guys, a quick question. I need to raise some some money to do something stupid (buy an RV as a rental to help a family member), and to do that I'm going to need to sell some stocks or bonds that I have. I am terribly attached to all of them and need your help choosing which would be good to sell. 

So of these groups, which would you think would underperform over the next 12-24 months, so I should consider selling them?

a) Index funds, mostly IVV (S&amp;P 500) but also other iShares fund groups for small cap and midcap.
b) Tech funds, namely QQQ, the Nasdaq top 100, and HACAX, a growth fund that's done great, hence I'm loath to sell any of it.
c) Very little Value, mostly a chunk of IVE.
d) Specific company stocks that all seem worth holding on to: AAPL, FB, TGE, DIS, F, VIS, DAL, GOOG, Aflac
e) Some other funds, like IEMG (emerging) or MTUM (a momentum play), IEUR (Europe) and IXUS (some international). You can tell I like to stick to iShares funds. 
f) A few REITS, mostly VNQ but a few others. 
g) Finally, my bonds, BND/AGG and LQD. The bonds have gone nowhere for years but then that's what bonds do.

So. I am torn here, needing to raise some funds but having trouble deciding what of these might do poorly over the next year, plus I'm not super happy about taking the profit . Honestly there's so much pessimism about bonds I am tempted to sell a chunk of those even though I already hold only 8% bonds/92% stocks and I'm 49 years old. I consider the RV rental as a possible bond proxy, as the income will likely be predictable. (My sister is a stable business I""ll be renting through.)

Thanks for any thoughts you can give!",-1

7pywrd,1515784514,aapl,Sold all my individual stock except AAPL for ETF's,"I've been pretty heavy in individual stocks the last 5 years. I averaged about a 25% return annualized, which is better than the S&amp;P500.

But at this point I just don't think its worth it to buy individual stocks when ETF's offer so much for such a low mgmt fee.

1. Takes so much time to keep tract and research individual stocks.

2. Its more stressful worrying that a few of your stocks could drop hard. I survived two 40% drops in AAPL.

3. Way too easy to take on too much risk and to little diversification

So now I'm just into ETF's like VTI, QQQ, and VOO.

I'm planning on holding AAPL till it hits $200 and I can sell it as a long term capital gain. 

I don't see myself getting into individual stocks unless the market totally changes in a couple years.

Please, and this is important, please, format your posts correctly. I'm not going to do it manually. It would be time consuming to find the posts, check the current price at the time of the post, do the quick math to find out if you have that much cash on hand, add the trade to the database, and all that other stuff. That could take me minutes to do for each symbol. I'd rather let a little script run through and be done with the entire thread in about 3mins.

Now, you might be wondering ""What is the correct format?"" It's this:

7q35sa,1515828390,gme,Combining Mythic GME and Microscope RPG for solo World-Building - Requesting thoughts and suggestions!,"So I've been doing some research about playing RPGs solo, and it looks like a lot of it comes from Random Tables. I've been playing around with Mythic GME and I like the way it uses Focus tables to direct random results.

For those who aren't familiar with Mythic, Focus tables are used before rolling for a random event to dictate what the *focus* of the random event is. For example, you roll on the Focus Table and get ""NPC negative"", which means whatever you roll for randomly after that will have to affect an NPC negatively. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I want to apply this concept to world-building, so I thought I'd make my own focus table for what kind of random things can happen in my world, specifically at the Period/Events level. Here are some of my ideas:

 A separate table for Periods/Events -

* Environmental Negative/Positive
* Environmental Action
* Introduce a new faction (race, species, society)
* Faction action 
* Faction Positive/Negative
* Faction Focus (e.g. agriculture, war, religion, etc) 
* Ambiguous Event

I've never played Microscope, and now that I look at it, the table looks really simplistic. Does anyone have any thoughts/suggestions as to what I can add to the table? Do you think it will work?

EDIT: Added 'Faction Focus' to table.",1

7q6mt2,1515872058,mcd,Getting violently ill from not eating meat regularly,"I've come to discover that if I don't eat animal protein in some form at least once daily I start to get badly sick. As a teenager I would occasionally go on a binge of eating nothing but Ramen and Carbs (mostly because I was too lazy to cook) and would get seriously ill. But I didn't think twice about it because I just figured it was because I was eating crappy food.

Years later I was dating a vegan and as a result I started eating vegan myself, because that's all she would cook. After a day or so of eating meat replacements like TVP + ground round I started getting the same symptoms, almost felt like food poisoning. But it went away almost immediately after eating meat again.

For example last week while I had the flu for a couple of days I was eating light only eating vegatable + lipton chicken soup, oatmeal, Orange juice, gatorade and misc carbs.

But after a couple days of that I started getting familiar stomach cramps, headaches, general ill feeling almost like food poisoning. If I let that continue for longer I would become violently ill, vomiting, gut pain, etc.

Knowing I have to eat meat I scrambled and ate a McD's hamburger, about 20 minutes later all symptoms went away.",1
7q6rvd,1515873342,msft,Windows 10 - things you love.,"It's easy to be negative and oh boy you can find plenty of it on this subreddit and other tech sites. However I want to take a different tack - look at the glass half full.

1. Login performance is now on par with macOS. The moment I hit enter after typing my pin, the login screen immediately fades away and shows the desktiop. Before FCU, there would be a spinning animation for a few seconds and a jarring transition. Microsoft finally fixed that, it's a BIG deal.

2. More Settings migrated from Control Panel! I know there's plenty left to do, but it's clear by now Microsoft has 'move Control Panel to Settings"" on their roadmap for each Redstone release and I think by Redstone 6 it will be 100% done.

3. Edge improvements. I'm talking FCU has better performance at least. From what I'm seeing on the Insider builds(better eBook reader, credit card autofill, better Hub), it's massively improving to the point that I may even consider switching to it by Redstone 6.

4. One Drive files on demand. This is HUGE. So many of us were demanding this and to just have it 'just work' as expected is a big deal. Thanks MSFT.

5. Start Menu. A few years back I never thought I'd use it, but I have lots of programs pinned to it and in folders as well. It's my go-to place for initiating lots of applications instead of the taskbar. I have very complaints about it and I'm sure Microsoft is always improving it.

6. What's coming. Timeline, Sets, improved eBook store and much more.

I can say for the first time since the glory days(Windows 2000) that I'm genuinely excited about what's coming from Microsoft and not so much from Apple anymore. 7 years ago I would have never thought that.

Congrats to Microsoft for turning this thing around!

P.S. To the mods - can we sticky this or you can create a new one for sticky. I think we need more positivity around here.",1

So I've been doing some research about playing RPGs solo, and it looks like a lot of it comes from Random Tables. I've been playing around with Mythic GME and I like the way it uses Focus tables to direct random results.

For those who aren't familiar with Mythic, Focus tables are used before rolling for a random event to dictate what the *focus* of the random event is. For example, you roll on the Focus Table and get ""NPC negative"", which means whatever you roll for randomly after that will have to affect an NPC negatively. I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, I want to apply this concept to world-building, so I thought I'd make my own focus table for what kind of random things can happen in my world, specifically at the Period/Events level. Here are some of my ideas:

 A separate table for Periods/Events -

* Environmental Negative/Positive
* Environmental Action
* Introduce a new faction (race, species, society)
* Faction action 
* Faction Positive/Negative
* Faction Focus (e.g. agriculture, war, religion, etc) 
* Ambiguous Event

I've never played Microscope, and now that I look at it, the table looks really simplistic. Does anyone have any thoughts/suggestions as to what I can add to the table? Do you think it will work?

EDIT: Added 'Faction Focus' to table.

EDIT2: Would like to ask a question I think would be more specific to this subreddit - What kind of things would it help me to research or look into while getting into a world-building mindset? How different is it from playing RPGs at the most detailed level vs. playing the Microscope RPG (which is focused on the ""Big Picture"")?",1

7qd2uf,1515950036,mcd,When your Muslim friend is searching for Halal food.,"I went out for dinner with a Pakistani-American friend I hadn't seen for awhile.  We agree on the restaurant and I got a flashback (or should I say PTSD?) when she started asking the waitress all sorts of questions related to halal food (surprise, she got more religious and didn't ask in the past about halal food).

It's been ages since I even thought of what was halal or haram. But watching her reminded me of the days when my parents or friends would admonish me for eating something like:

-Skittles/Starburst/[Insert random jelly based candy] or gum like Trident that contains gelatin.

-Any food cooked at a fast food joint that served pork (McD's, Wendys, Burger King, etc.; even if not pork they would say it's cooked on same grill as pork).

-Take out pizza (Shriek!! It has blah blah blah)

-Bakery items that contained lard, cysteine, lecithin, alcohol (hell, even Vanilla!).

...and on and on (huge list of products).


So my friend basically skims through the menu, asks all sorts of questions and  finds out the chicken is halal (or so they waitress says).   So she orders the chicken panini.  

And I just kept my damn mouth shut cause I figured the cheese probably contains rennet (or other pig fat), the butter could have pig lard, and they probably used the same panini machine to melt the sandwich as they do for all the pork-based paninis.

And it reminded me how most Muslims use whatever cognitive dissonance they believe to order food and comfort themselves (i.e. ""I tried to eat halal!"").

Me, I just kept my mouth shut! Also remembered how many times my parents would send me out to look for supermarket products with Halal/Kosher/Pareve on the label, like I was Carmen Sandiego.

I just don't want to step in right now with my real money but don't want my hard earned money to just sit there. 

So, I have been looking for a conservative options strategy to begin trading right now. Below are the following two options I have found.

1) Poor Man's Covered Call (MSFT and WMT) (Long Call : Deep ITM with delta 80+, Short Call with delta -20  )

2) Selling naked puts on SPY (Prob OTM = 80+)

My maximum risk is $500. Is there is someting better out there for me other than the above two? Do you have any tips for me?

I assumed that huge tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc would have their shares listed on TSX. I was very surprised when I realized they were not. So the only way to invest in those companies would be to convert CAD to USD (say using Norbert's Gambit) and hold them in my USD account? Then whenever I want to sell them, I have to do the reverse conversion if I want to use the money in Canada. 

Is there some other way I can buy stocks of those companies? Any suggestions on tech ETFs in Canada?",1

I have saved up $10,000 and ready to invest in options for the first time. So far, I have been watching all youtube videos and doing paper trading. This is my first trade with real money. I am really nervous (more than my first time with a girl lol)

I want to invest 80% in a conservative strategy. For remaining 20%, I want to take up more risk.

So here is what I think should be done

1) Buy leaps for MSFT and WMT (Deep ITM with delta 80+, maximum intrinsic value). Sell monthly covered calls to reduce cost basis. This will result in a debit of around $8000 (for Jan 2020)

2) Sell credit spreads on breakouts for top liquid ETFs and bluechips.

My maximum risk is $500. I want to take up small position and learn and absolutely don't want any big loss.
Am I doing it right? Any tips would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance :)

for rent/food/utilities/daily expenses I budget $1,000/month while college is in session. I am quite happy living on this budget, as I was raised to live frugal. Though to be fair, I get a decent bit (~1000/year) for birthday/Christmas and from other relatives, which allows me to have more fun.

I am a college student, and will graduate in May 2019.

I max out my Roth IRA contribution every year.

I do not want kids, do not want to get married for 6-10 years (if at all), and my long term goal is early retirement.

*Synopsis*  
The screen is filled with green, cascading code which gives way to the title, The Matrix.

A phone rings and text appears on the screen: ""Call trans opt: received. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC: Log&gt;"" As a conversation takes place between Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), two free humans, a table of random green numbers are being scanned and individual numbers selected, creating a series of digits not unlike an ordinary phone number, as if a code is being deciphered or a call is being traced.

Trinity discusses some unknown person. Cypher taunts Trinity, suggesting she enjoys watching him. Trinity counters that ""Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) says he may be 'the One',"" just as the sound of a number being selected alerts Trinity that someone may be tracing their call. She ends the call.

Armed policemen move down a darkened, decrepit hallway in the Heart O' the City Hotel, their flashlight beam bouncing just ahead of them. They come to room 303, kick down the door and find a woman dressed in black, facing away from them. It's Trinity. She brings her hands up from the laptop she's working on at their command.

Outside the hotel a car drives up and three agents appear in neatly pressed black suits. They are Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), Agent Brown (Paul Goddard), and Agent Jones (Robert Taylor). Agent Smith and the presiding police lieutenant argue. Agent Smith admonishes the policeman that they were given specific orders to contact the agents first, for their protection. The lieutenant dismisses this and says that they can handle ""one little girl"" and that he has two units that are bringing her down at that very moment. Agent Smith replies: ""No, Lieutenant. Your men are already dead.""

Inside, Trinity easily defeats the six policemen sent to apprehend her, using fighting and evasion techniques that seem to defy gravity. She calls Morpheus, letting him know that the line has been traced, though she doesn't know how. Morpheus informs her that she will have to ""make it to another exit,"" and that Agents are heading up after her.

A fierce rooftop chase ensues with Trinity and an Agent leaping from one building to the next, astonishing the policemen left behind. Trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. She has momentarily lost her pursuers and makes it to a public phone booth on the street level. The phone begins to ring. As she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by Agent Smith, careens towards the phone booth. Trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. The three Agents reunite at the front of the truck. There is no body in the wreckage. ""She got out,"" one says. The other says, ""The informant is real."" ""We have the name of their next target,"" says the other, ""His name is Neo.""

Neo (Keanu Reeves), a hacker with thick black hair and a sallow appearance, is asleep at his monitor. Notices about a manhunt for a man named Morpheus scroll across his screen as he sleeps. Suddenly Neo's screen goes blank and a series of text messages appear: ""Wake up, Neo."" ""The Matrix has you."" ""Follow the White Rabbit."" Then, the text says ""Knock, knock, Neo..."" just as he reads it, a knock comes at the door of his apartment, 101. It's a group of ravers and Neo gives them a contraband disc he has secreted in a copy of Simulacra and Simulation. The lead raver asks him to join them and Neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a small white rabbit on the shoulder of a seductive girl in the group.

At a rave bar Neo stands alone and aloof as the group he's with continue partying. Trinity approaches him and introduces herself. Neo recognizes her name; she was a famous hacker and had cracked the IRS database. She tells him that he is in great danger, that they are watching him and that she knows that he is searching for answers, particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix? The pulsing music of the bar gives way to the repetitious blare of Neo's alarm clock; it's 9:18 and he's late for work.

At his job at Metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise, Neo is berated by his boss for having a problem with authority, for thinking he's special. Neo listens to his boss, but his attention is on the persons cleaning the window of the office. Back at his bleak cubicle Neo receives a delivery as ""Thomas Anderson."" Upon opening the package he finds a cellphone which immediately rings. On the other end is Morpheus, who informs Neo that they've both run out of time and that ""they"" are coming for him. Morpheus tells him to slowly look up, toward the elevator. Agents Smith, Jones, and Brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards Neo's cube. Morpheus tries to guide Neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof Neo rejects Morpheus's advice, allowing himself to be taken by the Agents.

In an interrogation room the Agents confront Neo. They've had their eye on him for some time. He lives a dual existence: one life as Thomas A. Anderson, a software engineer for a Metacortex, the other life as Neo, a computer hacker ""guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for."" Agent Smith asks him to help them capture Morpheus, a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. Neo gives them the finger and asks for his phone call. Mr. Smith asks what good is a phone call if he's unable to speak. Neo finds that his lips have fused together. Panicked, he is thrown on the interrogation table by the Agents and they implant a shrimp-like probe, a bug, in his stomach, entering through his belly-button.

Neo awakens with a start in his own bed, assuming it has all been a bad dream. His phone rings and Morpheus is on the other line. He tells Neo that the line is tapped but they've underestimated his importance. Morpheus tells Neo he is the One and to meet him at the Adams St. bridge. There he is picked up by Trinity and two others in a car; they all wear black latex and leather. A woman in the front seat, Switch (Belinda McClory), pulls a gun on him and tells him to take off his shirt. Trinity tells him it's for their mutual protection and that he has to trust her. He takes off his shirt and she uses a device to remove the probe that Neo believed had been part of a nightmare. Trinity drops the bug out into the road where it slowly goes dark in the rain.

Trinity takes Neo to Morpheus. Morpheus explains that he's been searching for Neo his entire life and asks if Neo feels like ""Alice in Wonderland, falling down the rabbit hole."" He explains to Neo that they exist in the Matrix, a false reality that has been constructed for humans to hide the truth. The truth is that everyone in the world is a slave, born into bondage. Morpheus holds out two pills. In his left palm is a blue pill. If Neo takes it he will wake up in his bed and ""believe whatever you want to believe."" But if he takes the red pill in Morpheus's right hand, then ""you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."" Neo takes the red pill.

As the rest of Morpheus's crew straps him into a chair, Neo is told that pill he took is part of a trace program, to ""disrupt his input/output carrier signal"" so that they can pinpoint him. Neo looks at a shattered mirror placed next to him which miraculously reforms itself. Neo touches the surface and the silver begins to creep over his skin, engulfing him as Morpheus's crew attempt to locate something on the monitors around them. The silver takes Neo over and he blacks out.

He awakens inside a pinkish/purple embryonic pod, extending from the side of a circular building, a massive power plant. He is hairless and naked, with thick black tubes snaking down his throat, plugged into the back of his skull, his spine, and invading most of the rest of his body. He finds his pod is open and that he is surrounded by tower after tower of pods just like his, all filled with bodies. Suddenly a menacing, hovering nurse robot grabs him by the throat. The tubes detach and Neo is flushed down a tube into an underground pool of filthy water. Just as he's about to drown in the muck a hovercraft appears above him, snags him and hauls him into its cargo bay. Neo finds himself surrounded by Morpheus's crew again, but they are dressed differently, in simple knit garments. Just before Neo passes out Morpheus says to him, ""Welcome to the real world.""

Neo drifts in and out of consciousness. At one point he asks, ""Am I dead?"" ""Far from it,"" replies Morpheus. Again he wakes, his body a pincushion of acupuncture. ""Why do my eyes hurt?"" he asks. ""You've never used them,"" Morpheus replies.

Neo finally wakes, fully clothed, with a short shock of hair on his head. He removes a connector that is sunk deep into his arm and reaches to find the large socket at the back of his neck when Morpheus enters the room. ""What is this place?"" Neo asks. ""The more important question is when,"" says Morpheus, ""You believe it is the year 1999, when in fact it is closer to the year 2199."" Morpheus goes on to say that they really don't know when it is. He gives Neo a tour of his ship, the Nebuchadnezzar (they pass a plaque stating it was built in 2069). Neo is introduced to Morpheus's crew including Trinity; Apoc (Julian Arahanga), a man with long, flowing black hair; Switch; Cypher (bald with a goatee); two brawny brothers, Tank (Marcus Chong) and Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker); and a young, thin man named Mouse (Matt Doran).

Morpheus gets to the point. ""You wanted to know about the Matrix,"" he says, ushering him to a chair. Neo sits down in it and Trinity straps him in. A long probe is inserted into the socket at the back of Neo's skull.

Neo wakes in a world of all white. He is in the Construct, a ""loading platform"" that Morpheus and his team use to prepare newly freed humans to deal with the Matrix world. Gone are the sockets in Neo's arms and neck. He has hair again. Morpheus tells him that what he is experiencing of himself is the ""residual self image, the mental projection of your digital self"" and bids him to sit while he explains the truth. ""This,"" he says, showing an image of a modern city, ""is the world that you know."" A thing that really exists ""only as part of a neural, interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.""

Morpheus then shows Neo the world as it truly exists today, a scarred, desolate emptiness with charred, abandoned buildings, black earth, and a shrouded sky.

Morpheus goes on to say that ""at some point in the early 21st century all of mankind was united in celebration as we gave birth"" to artificial intelligence, a ""singular consciousness that birthed an entire race of machines.""

Someone started a war, and no one knows who, but it was known that it was mankind who blotted out the sky, attempting to deprive the machines of the solar power they required to function. Instead the machines turned to humans as a power source; Mopheus explains that a human's body provides ""more electricity than a 120 volt battery and over 25k BTUs in body heat."" Morpheus shows Neo fields where machines grow human beings, connecting them to their outlets, ensconcing them in their pods, and feeding them with the liquefied remains of other human beings. ""The Matrix,"" says Morpheus, ""is a computer-generated dreamworld created to keep us under control, to turn us..."" into a mere power source, into coppertop batteries.

Neo rejects this information so feverishly that he pulls himself out of the Construct. He is back in the chair on the hovercraft. He fights to free himself from this harsh reality, only to end up vomiting on the floor and passing out.

When Neo wakes up in his bunk, Morpheus is beside him. ""I can't go back, can I?"" Neo asks. ""No,"" says Morpheus. He apologizes to Neo for breaking a cardinal rule: after a certain age people aren't brought out of their simulacrum, but Morpheus explains he had to bring Neo out. When the Matrix was created there was a man born inside it who could create his own reality inside it. It was this man who set Morpheus and the others free. When he died, the Oracle (Gloria Foster) prophesied that he would return in another form. And that the return of the One would mean the destruction of the Matrix. As long as the Matrix exists, humanity will continue to live in complacency inside it and the world can never be free. ""I did what I did because I believe that search is over,"" says Morpheus.

The next day Neo starts his training. Tank is his operator. Tank and his brother Dozer are ""100% pure old-fashioned, homegrown human. Born in the real world; a genuine child of Zion."" Zion, Tank explains, is the last human city, buried deep in the earth, near the core, for warmth. Tank straps Neo back into the jack-in chair, by-passes some preliminary programs and loads him up with combat training, starting with Jiu Jitsu. When Tank hits ""load"" Neo is shocked by the force of the knowledge pouring into him. ""I think he likes it,"" says Tank, ""want some more?"" ""Hell yes,"" replies Neo. Neo is fed a series of martial arts techniques including Kempo, Tae Kwon Do, Drunken Boxing and Kung Fu. Morpheus and Tank are amazed at Neo's ability to ingest information, but Morpheus wants to test Neo.

Morpheus and Neo stand in a sparring program. The program has rules, like gravity. But as in many computer programs, some rules can be bent while others can be broken. Morpheus bids Neo to hit him, if he can. They fight with Neo impressively attacking but Morpheus easily parrying and subduing him. The rest of the crew gathers around the monitors to watch the fight. Morpheus ends up kicking Neo into a beam, explaining to him that the reason he has beaten him has nothing to do with muscles or reality. They spar again. ""What are you waiting for?"" Morpheus asks him. ""You're faster than this!"" Neo finally brings a punch near his teacher's face. They can move on.

A jump program is loaded. Both men now stand on one of several tall buildings in a normal city skyline. Morpheus tells Neo he must free his mind and leaps from one building to the next. Neo nervously tries to follow him and doesn't make the jump, falling to the pavement below. Neo wakes back in the Nebudchanezzar with blood in his mouth. ""I thought it wasn't real,"" he says. ""Your mind makes it real,"" replies Morpheus. ""So, if you die in the Matrix, you die here?"" ""The body cannot live without the mind,"" says Morpheus, underlining the very real danger faced in the simulation.

Later, Trinity brings Neo dinner. Outside his room, Cypher remarks that Trinity never brought him dinner. He asks Trinity why, if Morpheus thinks Neo is the One, he hasn't taken him to see the Oracle yet. Trinity says he'll take him when he's ready.

Morpheus and Neo are walking down a standard city street in what appears to be the Matrix. Morpheus explains that the Matrix is a system and that the system is their enemy. All the people that inhabit it, the people they are trying to free, are part of that system. Some are so inert, so dependent upon the Matrix that they can never be free. Neo notices a stunning girl in a red dress. ""Are you listening to me?"" asks Morpheus. He asks Neo to look at the girl again. Neo turns to face Agent Smith, pointing a gun straight at his head. Morpheus stops the simulation, which has just been created to look like the Matrix.

Neo asks what the Agents are. ""Sentient programs,"" says Morpheus, that ""can move in and out of any software hard-wired into their system, meaning that they can take over anyone in the Matrix program. ""Inside the Matrix,"" Morpheus says, ""They are everyone and they are no one."" Thus Morpheus and his crew survive the Agents by running from them and hiding from the Agents even though they ""are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys and sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them."" But no one who has ever stood up to an Agent has survived; all have died. Still, Morpheus is certain that because the Agents live in a world of rules that they can never be as strong, never be as fast as he can be. ""What are you trying to tell me,"" asks Neo, ""That I can dodge bullets?"" ""When you're ready,"" Morpheus says, ""You won't have to."" Just then Morpheus gets a phone call. ""We've got trouble,"" Cypher says on the other line.

The Nebuchadnezzar is on alert. They see the holographic image of a squiddy, a search and destroy sentinel, which is on their trail. They set the ship down in a huge sewer system and turn off the power. Tank stands at the ready switch of an EMP, electro-magnetic pulse, the only weapon man has against the machines in the real world. Two squiddies search for the ship -- the crew can see them -- but they move on.

Neo startles Cypher, who is working at a computer console streaming with green code. Cypher offers Neo a drink and says that he knows what Neo is thinking, ""Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?"" Neo laughs but is unsettled. Cypher asks Neo if Morpheus has told him why he's here. Neo nods. ""What a mind job,"" says Cypher, ""so you're here to save the world.""

Cypher is now in a fancy restaurant with Agent Smith in the Matrix. Agent Smith asks if they have a deal. Cypher cuts up a juicy steak and ruminates that he knows the steak is merely the simulation telling his brain that it is delicious and juicy, but after nine years he has discovered that ""ignorance is bliss."" He strikes a deal for the machines to reinsert his body into a power plant, reinsert him into the Matrix, and he'll help the Agents. He wants to be rich and powerful, ""an actor"" maybe. Smith says he wants access codes to the mainframe in Zion. Cypher says he can't do that, but that he can get him the man who does, meaning Morpheus.

Meanwhile, inside the Nebuchadnezzar's small dining room in the real world, the rest of the crew is trying to choke down the oatmeal-gruel that they have as sustenance. Mouse muses on the mistakes the machines may have made trying to get sensations right, like the taste of chicken. Since they didn't know what it tasted like they let everything taste like it. Morpheus interrupts the meal, announcing that he's taking Neo to see the Oracle.

Morpheus, Trinity, Neo, Apoc, Switch, Mouse and Cypher are jacked into the Matrix. As they walk out of a warehouse Cypher secretly throws his cell phone into the garbage. On the car ride to the Oracle, Neo asks Trinity if she has seen the Oracle. Trinity says that she has but when she's asked just what she was told by the Oracle, she refuses to answer.

The Oracle, Morpheus explains, has been with them since the beginning of the Resistance. She is the one who made the Prophecy of the One and that Morpheus would be the one to find him. She can help Neo find the path, he says. He enters the apartment of the Oracle. Inside are the other potentials: a mother figure and numerous children. One child levitates blocks, one reads Asian literature, another is playing chess. One bald child is bending spoons. He gives one spoon to Neo and says, ""Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...that there is no spoon."" Neo bends the spoon as he's called in to see the Oracle.

The Oracle is baking cookies. She sizes Neo up and asks him whether he thinks he is the One. Neo admits that he does not know and the Oracle does not enlighten him. Neo smiles and the Oracle asks him what is funny. Neo admits that Morpheus had almost convinced him that he was the One. She accepts this and prophesies that Morpheus believes in Neo so much that he plans to sacrifice himself. She tells Neo that either he or Morpheus will die, and that Neo will have the power to choose which one it will be. She then offers him a cookie and promises him that he will feel fine as soon as he's done eating it.

As the crew returns to their jack point, many floors up in an old hotel, Tank, in the control room, notices something odd. Meanwhile Neo, walking up the stairs, sees what appears to be the same cat cross a room twice. ""Deja vu,"" he says, which gets the attention of Trinity and Morpheus. Deja vu, they explain to him, is a glitch in the Matrix; it happens when they reset the computer parameters. Outside, the phone line is cut. Mouse runs to a window which has now been bricked in. They are trapped. Mouse picks up two machine guns but he's no match for the police coming into the room. He's riddled with bullets.

Back on the Nebuchadnezzar, the real Mouse spurts blood from his mouth and dies in the chair.

More police and Agents stream into the bottom of the hotel. Morpheus has Tank find a layout of the building they're in, locating the main wet wall. The Agents arrive on the floor they're on, finding a coat that Cypher has left behind. They only find a hole in the bathroom wall. Meanwhile the crew is climbing down the plumbing of the wet wall. As the police approach Cypher sneezes, once more giving them away. The police open fire. The crew, including Neo, begin to fire back.

An Agent takes over the body of one of the policemen, reaches into the wall, and grabs Neo by the neck. Morpheus, who is above Neo in the walls, breaks through the wall and lands on the agent, yelling to Trinity to get Neo out of the building.

A fierce battle between Agent Smith and Morpheus ends with Morpheus face down on the tile. Agent Smith sends the police unit in to beat him with their batons.

Cypher returns to the Nebuchadnezzar before Trinity, Neo, Switch and Apoc. As Tank attempts to bring the others back, Cypher attacks him from behind with an electronic weapon. Dozer attempts to tackle Cypher, but Cypher electrocutes him as well.

Trinity attempts to call Tank but Cypher pulls the headset off of the smoking remains of Tank and answers. As Cypher talks to Trinity inside the Matrix he leans over the still form of Trinity in the hovercraft. Cypher recounts the things he hates about the real world, the war, the cold, the goop they have to eat, but most especially Morpheus and his beliefs. ""He lied to us, Trinity.""

Cypher pulls the plug out of the back of Apoc's head, and Apoc falls down dead in the Matrix. Cypher then moves to Switch and as she protests ""Not like this..."" in the Matrix, Cypher kills her on the ship. She falls down dead before Trinity and Neo. Cypher moves on to Neo's supine form, saying that if Neo is the One, a miracle will prevent Cypher from killing him:

""How can he be the One, if he's dead?"" he asks. He continues badgering Trinity, asking her if she believes that Neo is the One. She says, ""Yes."" Cypher screams back ""No!"" but his reaction is incredulity at seeing Tank still alive, brandishing the weapon that Cypher had used on him. Tank fries Cypher with the electrical device.

Tank brings Trinity back and she finds out that Dozer is dead.

Meanwhile Agent Smith, a tray of torture instruments near him, marvels at the beauty of the Matrix as he gazes out at the city all around them. He informs Morpheus, who is tied to a chair, that the first Matrix was designed as a utopia, engineered to make everyone happy. ""It was a disaster,"" says Agent Smith, people wouldn't accept the program and ""entire crops were lost."" ""Some believed,"" continues Smith, ""that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned."" Agent Smith compares humans to dinosaurs and that evolution is taking hold. Another Agent enters and relays that there may be a problem (as they now know that Cypher has failed).

Back on the hovercraft the shuddering form of Morpheus betrays the torture he's being put through by the Agents in the Matrix. Tank realizes that they're trying to get the codes to the mainframes of Zion's computers; each ship's captain knows them. Because a breach of Zion's defenses would mean that the last remaining vestiges of mankind would be wiped out, Tank says their only choice is to unplug Morpheus, effectively killing him.

Back in the Matrix, the Agents process their next move. If Cypher is dead, they deduce that the remaining humans on the ship will terminate Morpheus. They decide to stick to their original plan and to deploy the Sentinels.

Tank is performing what amounts to last rites for Morpheus, laying one hand on his head as his other moves to the back of his skull to remove the jack. Just as he's about to pull it out Neo stops him. He realizes that the Oracle was right. He now has to make the choice to save himself or to save Morpheus; his choice is to head back into the Matrix. Trinity rejects the idea. Morpheus gave himself up so that Neo could be saved since he is the One.

""I'm not the One, Trinity,"" Neo says, relaying his understanding of the discussion with the Oracle: she did not enlighten him as to whether he was the promised messiah. And, since Morpheus was willing to sacrifice himself, Neo knows that he must do that same. Tank calls it suicide; it's a military building with Agents inside. Neo says he only knows that he can bring Morpheus out. Trinity decides to come with him, reasoning with Neo that he will need her help and she's the ranking officer on the ship. ""Tank,"" she says, ""load us up!""

Meanwhile Agent Smith continues to share his musings with a brutalized Morpheus. Because humans spread to an area, consume the natural resources and, to survive, must spread to another area, Smith says we are not mammals but viruses, the only other creature that acts that way.

In the Construct, Neo and Trinity get armaments. ""Neo,"" protests Trinity, ""No one has ever done anything like this."" ""That's why it's going to work,"" he replies.

Morpheus has yet to break and Smith asks the other Agents why the serum isn't working. ""Maybe we're asking the wrong questions,"" responds one. To that Smith commands the other Agents to leave him alone with Morpheus. Smith removes his earphone and his glasses and confides that he hates the Matrix, ""this zoo, this prison."" Smith admits that he must get out of this ""reality."" He hates the stench. He's sure that some element of the humans will rub off on him and that Morpheus holds the key to his release. If there is no Zion there's no need for Smith to be in the Matrix. ""You are going to tell me, or you are going to die.""

Downstairs, in the lobby, Trinity and Neo enter, heavily armed. They shoot their way past the guards and a group of soldiers and make their way into the elevator.

Agents Brown and Jones enter the interrogation room to find Smith with his hands still fixed on Morpheus's head. Smith looks embarrassed and befuddled and the others tell him about the attack occurring downstairs. They realize that the humans are trying to save Morpheus.

In the elevator, Trinity arms a bomb. They both climb through a hatch to the elevator roof, attaching a clamp to the elevator cable. Neo says ""There is no spoon"" before he severs the cable with a few shots. The counterweight drops, propelling Neo and Trinity upward. The elevator falls to the lobby exploding upon impact and filling the floor with flames.

The Agents feel the rumble of the explosion and the sprinkers come on in the building. ""Find them and destroy them!"" Smith commands.

On the roof, a helicopter pilot is calling ""Mayday"" as Trinity and Neo take out the soldiers there. Agent Brown takes over the pilot and appears behind Neo. Neo shoots several rounds at the Agent, who dodges them and pulls his own weapon.

""Trinity,"" yells Neo, ""Help!"" But it's too late. The Agent begins to shoot. Instead of being shot, Neo dodges most of the bullets, though two of them nick him. As the Agent approaches Neo, who is lying on the ground, he levels a kill shot but Trinity shoots him before he can fire. Trinity marvels at how fast Neo has just moved; she's never seen anyone move that quickly.

Tank downloads the ability to fly the helicopter to Trinity, who can now pilot the aircraft. Trinity brings the helicopter down to the floor that Morpheus is on and Neo opens fire on the three Agents. The Agents quickly fall and Morpheus is alone in the room. Just as quickly the Agents take over other soldiers stationed nearby. Morpheus breaks his bonds and begins to run to the helicopter. The Agents fire on him, hitting his leg. Morpheus leaps but Neo realizes that he is not going to make the leap and throws himself out of the helicopter, a safety harness attached.

He catches Morpheus, but Agent Smith shoots the helicopter's hydraulic line.

Unable to control the helicopter, Trinity miraculously gets it close enough to drop Morpheus and Neo on a rooftop. Neo grabs the safety line as the helicopter falls towards a building. Trinity severs the safety line connecting Neo to the helicopter and jumps on it herself as the vehicle smashes into the side of a building, causing a bizarre ripple in the fabric of the building's reality as it does.

On the ship Tank says, ""I knew it; he's the One.""

Neo hauls Trinity up to them. ""Do you believe it now, Trinity?"" asks Morpheus as he approaches the two. Neo tries to tell him that the Oracle told him the opposite but Morpheus says, ""She told you exactly what you needed to hear."" They call Tank, who tells them of an exit in a subway near them.

The Agents arrive on the rooftop but find only the safety harness and line. Though Agent Smith is angered, the other two are satisfied. A trace has been completed in the real world and the Sentinels have been dispatched to attack the Nebuchadnezzar.

In the subway, they quickly find the phone booth and Morpheus exits out of the Matrix. A wino watches this occur. On the rooftop Agent Smith locks in to their whereabouts through the wino and appropriates his body.

Meanwhile, as the phone rings, providing Trinity's exit, she confides to Neo that everything that the Oracle has told her has come true, except for one thing. She doesn't say what that thing is and picks up the phone just as she sees the approaching Agent Smith. Smith shatters the ear piece of the phone; it's impossible for Neo to exit there now.

Instead of running, which Trinity implores him to do as she looks on from the ship, Neo turns to face Smith. They empty their guns on each other, neither hitting the other. They then move into close combat, trading blows. Neo sweeps Agent Smith's head, breaking his glasses. ""I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson,"" says Smith. They trade some thunderous blows with Smith hitting Neo so hard he spits up blood in the Matrix and in the chair aboard the ship.

""He's killing him,"" says Trinity.

Neo gets back up, sets himself and beckons Smith to start again. This time it's Neo who delivers devastating blow after blow. But Smith counters, throwing Neo into a wall then pummeling him with body blows. A wind from the tunnel signals that a subway train is approaching and Smith has a wicked notion. He throws Neo into the subway tracks then drops down there himself. He puts Neo in a headlock and, in the glow of the oncoming subway says, ""You hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. It is the sound of your death. Good-bye, Mr. Anderson.""

""My name,"" he replies, ""is Neo."" Then, with a mighty leap, Neo propels them to the ceiling of the tunnel. They fall back down and Neo backflips off the tracks, leaving Agent Smith to the oncoming train.

Neo heads for the stairs, but Smith has already appropriated another body and emerges from the doors of the train.

Meanwhile the Sentinels have arrived to attack the Nebuchadnezzar; there are five of them and they are closing fast.

Morpheus tells Tank to charge the EMP. Trinity reminds Morpheus that they can't use the EMP while Neo is in the Matrix.

""I know, Trinity, don't worry,"" says Morpheus, ""He's going to make it.""

Back in the streets of the Matrix, Neo swipes a cell phone from a nearby suit. He calls Tank: ""Mr. Wizard, get me the hell out of here."" He races through a crowded market while Agents appropriate bodies right and left. They force Neo down a dark alley. He kicks in a door and rushes through an apartment complex where the Agents appropriate more bodies, including that of a sweet little old lady who throws a knife at Neo as Agent Smith. Neo leaps down into a pile of garbage with the Agents in hot pursuit.

On the Nebuchadnezzar the Sentinels have arrived. They begin to tear the ship apart.

In the Matrix, Neo arrives back at the Heart O' the City Hotel. Tank tells him to go to room 303. The Agents are literally at his heels.

The Sentinels breach the hull of the ship. They are inside. Trinity, standing next to Neo's body in the chair, begs him to hurry.

Neo reaches room 303 and enters. He's immediately shot, point blank in the gut, by Agent Smith. Smith empties his magazine into Neo's body. Neo slumps to the floor, dead.

On the ship Neo's vital signs drop to nothing. ""It can't be,"" says Morpheus.

Agent Smith instructs the others to check Neo. ""He's gone,"" one replies. ""Good-bye, Mr. Anderson,"" says Smith.

The Sentinels' lasers are beginning to cut through the major parts of the hovercraft. Trinity leans over his dead body.

""Neo,"" she says, ""I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love and that that man... the man that I loved would be the One. So you see, you can't be dead. You can't be... because I love you. You hear me? I love you."" She kisses him. In the chair Neo suddenly breathes. In the Matrix, Neo opens his eyes. ""Now get up,"" orders Trinity.

The Agents hear Neo rise behind them and they open fire. ""No,"" Neo says calmly, raising his hands. He stops their bullets in mid-air. They drop harmlessly to the floor.

""What's happening?"" asks Tank. ""He is the One,"" says Morpheus.

Back in the Matrix, Neo can see things for what they really are, green cascading code.

Agent Smith is furious. He runs to Neo and attacks him. Neo blocks Smith's blows effortlessly before he sends Smith flying with one well-placed kick. Neo then leaps into Smith's body and appropriates him. Smith's shell explodes in a sea of code and Neo is all that is left, the walls buckling in waves as they did when the helicopter crashed. Agents Brown and Jones look at one another and run away.

The Sentinels are now fully in the ship. They are right above Trinity and Morpheus.

Back in the Matrix Neo sprints to the ringing phone in the room.

Morpheus has no choice but to engage the EMP. He does and the Sentinels fall inert to the floor.

Neo has made it back. He kisses Trinity.

The screen is black. A command prompt appears: ""Call trans opt: received. 9-18-99 14:32:21 REC: Log&gt;"" then ""Carrier anomaly"" ""Trace program: running"" As the grid of numbers appears again a warning appears ""System Failure."" Over it all is Neo's voice:

""I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.""

In the Matrix world, Neo hangs up the phone. He looks at the mindless masses around him, puts on his glasses and then looks up. From high above the city we see him take flight. The story is picked up in The Matrix Reloaded (2003), the second of three Matrix movies.

*Synopsis*  
The Walt Disney Pictures logo and the movie title appear to the Norwegian song ""Vuelie"".

In a winter landscape, ice harvesters use saws and hooks to cut blocks of ice from a lake, chanting as they work about how ice is a powerful force that's both beautiful and dangerous (""Frozen Heart""). They load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. A young eight year old boy named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) works alongside them (not very expertly), accompanied by his reindeer Sven (sounds: also Jonathan Groff). They try to imitate the ice harvesters with a single cubical block of ice and a small child's sled, and follow them away as the Northern Lights fill the night sky.

The camera follows the Northern Lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a Scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. That night, Princess Elsa of Arendelle (Eva Bella) is fast asleep when her five year old sister Princess Anna (Livvy Stubenrauch) tries to wake her up, wanting Elsa to play with her. Elsa playfully brushes Anna off, until Anna asks, ""do you wanna build a snowman?"" to which Elsa delightfully agrees.

Fully awake, the two sisters run downstairs to the ballroom. At Anna's urging, Elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. It explodes, raining snow down on them. To enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. They create a snowman that she nicknames Olaf, who likes warm hugs. The girls play gleefully with Olaf until Anna makes a leap Elsa wasn't prepared for and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow hits Anna in the head, knocking her out and turning several strands of her hair white. Their parents, King Agdar and Queen Idun rush in, responding to Elsa's cries of anguish. They check on Anna and find her cold to the touch. Agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains.

As the royal family gallops through the forests at full speed, they pass by Kristoff, who is still being dragged on his sled by Sven. He becomes curious about the fact that one of the horses is leaving behind a trail of ice, in the middle of the summer.

Kristoff and Sven follow the ice trail to an empty clearing that appears to only be populated by a large assortment of moss-covered boulders. From the edge of the clearing, Kristoff watches as Agdar asks the motionless boulders to help him. Seconds later, all the boulders roll into a large circle around Agdar, Idun, Elsa, and the unconscious Anna. The rocks uncurl, revealing themselves to be trolls. The ""boulder"" Kristoff and Sven are watching the event from behind is another rock troll named Bulda, who immediately decides to adopt the visitors after Sven licks her.

Grand Pabbie (Ciarán Hinds), the leader of the trolls, shows up and asks Agdar if Elsa was born or cursed with her abilities. He observes that Anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. He advises the family that it might be best if Elsa doesn't use her powers around Anna. He alters Anna's memories so she has no knowledge of her sister's powers, remembering only the fun they've had (for instance, Anna will remember her indoor castle ice rink as a mundane winter day). Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy.

So Agdar and Idun take measures into their own hands based on what Grand Pabbie has told them. The palace is closed to most visitors. Staffing is reduced to a minimum. Anna and Elsa are separated, and having no memory of what has occurred, Anna is unable to comprehend why Elsa is not allowed to play with her. She often comes to Elsa's closed door and tries to coax her out by asking her if she wants to build a snowman (""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?""). As a further precaution, the sisters are also kept from leaving the castle.

While Anna's life is dull but normal, Elsa's powers grow stronger as she matures. Her father cautions her to wear gloves to keep her icy magic in check, and to conceal her feelings, because strong emotions seem to cause her powers to manifest in unexpected ways.

Ten years after the accident, the now teenaged princesses become orphans when their parents' ship capsizes in a storm, drowning them. After the burial, Anna goes again to Elsa's door, pleading for consolation from her only remaining family member. But Elsa, though she sits sadly on the the other side of the door, refuses to communicate with Anna.

Three Years Later:

Elsa (now voiced by Idina Menzel) is now 21 years old, comes of age, and the castle prepares to crown her as the kingdom's queen. Dignitaries from around Europe are coming to visit, including the Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk), who wants to run Arendelle's profits dry.

Elsa is nervous about emerging from her seclusion and receiving the many guests. When Elsa gives the order to open the castle gates, Anna (now voiced by Kristen Bell) eagerly rushes out into the city (""For the First Time In Forever"").

As Anna strolls out onto the streets, she crashes into a horse belonging to a charming and handsome visitor, and falls into a rowboat. The visitor apologizes and introduces himself as Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), in town for Elsa's coronation. Though Anna is angered at first by Hans's clumsiness (after inadvertently falling on top of her in the rowboat due to said rowboat teetering on the side of a dock and being balanced only by a leg from Hans's horse), she seems smitten by him once she has a real good look at him. Anna runs off when she hears the church bells.

Elsa remains nervous during the coronation ceremony. The bishop (Robert Pine) has to remind her to remove her gloves before she takes up her golden orb and scepter. Holding them, she turns to face the congregation, but almost immediately panics when she sees the gold of the orb starting to frost while the bishop is bestowing her authority on her. She returns the orb and scepter hurriedly to the bishop and puts her gloves back on.

At the coronation reception a couple hours later, Kai introduces Elsa and Anna to the crowd. Anna's first friendly interaction with Elsa in years brings quite the delightful feeling to Anna, flustered at first, as well as seeing Elsa so happy instead of serious and preserved boosts Anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. They're interrupted afterwards by Kai introducing to them the Duke of Weselton. The Duke is a buffoon (to the point that a running gag throughout the movie is people calling his homeplace ""Weasel Town""), but an important trading partner. Elsa politely declines his offer to dance with her, but instead playfully volunteers Anna, much to the Duke's delight nonetheless, and the two head off into a comical dance scene. Elsa can't resist chuckling seeing Anna get innocently flustered by the Duke's over-the-top (and incredibly terrible) dancing skills. This causes Anna to feel just as whimsical about the entire matter, for seeing Elsa in such a state hasn't been a sight for years. Anna returns by Elsa's side afterwards, commenting on how well things have been going through the day, and expresses her wishes to have things the way they were that night all the time. Elsa does agree, though her smile quickly fades away as memories of the night she froze Anna's head come floating back to the surface, and she reluctantly denies Anna's wishes all at once despite failing to explain why so.

Anna then takes to the floor with Hans. The two of them quickly sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. The romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date (""Love is an Open Door""), with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. Hans, during their time together, learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids. Hans openly relates to this, only furthering Anna's connection with him. Hans then promises to never shut Anna out unlike Elsa, much to the princess' absolute joy.

By the end of their tour throughout the kingdom, Hans proposes right on the spot to which Anna immediately accepts. The two head back the ballroom, where Anna asks for Elsa's blessing on the marriage. Elsa's baffled by the shocking news, but Anna and Hans couldn't appear more excited going on to ramble about the wedding arrangements. Elsa ceases the sudden rambling by denying them a marriage license, much to Anna's dismay. Elsa asks to speak to Anna alone in private, likely to finally confess her abilities and why it's not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would expose her powers, but Anna refuses any private conversation, stating whatever Elsa has to say can be said to both her and Hans. Elsa, becoming impatient and frustrated, outright refuses to let Anna marry someone she just met, indirectly telling Anna she knows nothing about true love. This causes Anna to hiss back, telling Elsa all she knows is how to shut people out. Although Elsa is visibly hurt by this, she continues to refuse, with the argument only worsening when she orders the guards to end the party early and close the gates.

Unable to contain her emotions, Elsa makes a violent sweep with her left arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to suddenly appear around her. Shocked at the room's reaction to her powers, Elsa rushes from the room.

Panicking, Elsa flees with Anna in hot pursuit. As she bolts out the door, she finds a huge crowd waiting for her in the courtyard. She hastily rushes through as men applaud her. A concerned woman asks Elsa if she's all right. She is frightened enough that she backs into an ornamental fountain and freezes it solid when she grabs it with her left hand. The Duke of Weselton comes out the same door moments later. Elsa pleads for people to step back, moments before another bolt of ice shoots from her hands, nearly hitting the Duke and his guards. She keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet forming an ice bridge, and vanishes into the forest on the other side of the fjord.

Anna calls after her sister, but as she, Hans, and the other guests watch, the waters of the fjord completely ice over and the air takes on an icy chill. Moments later, snow begins to fall.

The Duke of Weselton begins to panic, declaring they must take action and put an end to Elsa's curse. Anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out Elsa herself and make things right, feeling that it's her fault for pushing her. With Hans being left in charge of the kingdom, Anna sets out on horse to begin her search for Elsa.

Meanwhile, Elsa has found her way to a high precipice on the North Mountain, many miles from civilization. It is here she realizes that far away from what she was taught, being on her own, she can begin to control her powers (""Let it Go""). She constructs an elaborate ice palace, changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering dress, and vows to stay in seclusion, where she feels she can be herself, and harm no one else.

The next morning, Anna is seen travelling slowly through knee-deep snow on horseback. Her journey is hindered when her horse is spooked by falling snow and runs off. She is forced to spend the rest of the day trudging through knee deep snow, all the while griping that she wishes Elsa had the ability to cover the fjords in a tropical paradise. She sighs with relief upon seeing a building with smoke coming from a chimney. Just then, Anna slips and falls into an ice-cold creek, which freezes her dress stiff. She staggers the rest of the way to the cabin with the chimney, a place known as Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna, run by its burly owner, Oaken (Chris Williams).

Anna quickly staggers into Oaken's store. He doesn't have much winter gear in stock (it's supposed to be the off season), aside from one pair of boots and a single women's mink coat. Anna inquires if Elsa has visited recently, but Oaken tells her that she's the only person crazy enough to be out in a storm like this. As if on cue, Kristoff staggers in out of the storm, seeking to buy some rope, an axe, and carrots for Sven. Oaken can't help but notice that Kristoff is bundled up tightly. Kristoff replies that there's a real howler going on up on the North Mountain. As Anna waits for Oaken to return his attention to her, Kristoff argues with Oaken over the outrageous price gouging on the items he needs (due to Oaken claiming that there's a supply and demand problem since Kristoff is buying from the almost-bare shelves of the winter department), which ends with Oaken roughly throwing Kristoff out into the snow after Kristoff makes the mistake of calling him a crook.

Kristoff and Sven take refuge in a barn on Oaken's property, but are soon met by Anna, who has bought Kristoff's supplies for him, on condition he take her up the North Mountain immediately. Kristoff eventually agrees.

Anna and Kristoff set off into the night with Sven driving. As the discussion turns to Elsa, Anna explains about her whirlwind engagement to Hans. Kristoff is incredulous at Anna's foolhardiness in getting engaged to someone she just met that day, to the point that he quizzes her about Hans to see how little she really knows about him. Their conversation is interrupted when the sled is ambushed by a pack of wolves. Kristoff is initially reluctant to let Anna assist him, but Anna proves to be useful and manages to take out a few of the wolves by herself. There is a moment of panic when the two see a gaping ravine up ahead. Kristoff hurriedly throws Anna onto Sven's back, then, just as they reach the cliff, he uses his knife to cut Sven's harness. Anna and Sven successfully clear the chasm, and Kristoff does, just barely, but his sled falls to the bottom of the ravine and explodes. Kristoff is at first upset that his sled is gone (as he'd just paid it off), but after ""arguing"" with Sven (which consists of Kristoff speaking his own opinion in his own voice and then delivering Sven's ""counterargument"" in a goofy voice), decides to help Anna keep going, worried for her safety. Anna promises she will replace the sled.

Early the next morning, Anna and Kristoff enter a frosted-over glen. They suddenly hear a new voice and meet a talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). The introductions don't go smoothly, as Anna screams and kicks Olaf's head off upon first seeing him. Anna doesn't recognize Olaf until he gives his name and adds, ""and I like warm hugs."" This jogs Anna's memories and she remembers building him with Elsa when they were young. Anna and Kristoff mention that they're looking for Elsa so they can restore summertime, and Olaf suddenly grows excited; it's his dream to see what summer is like, and he fantasizes about what he wants to do in the summertime in a Busby-Berkeley dance number (""In Summer""). Anna and Kristoff choose not to reveal that he will melt in the summer heat, but follow him as he leads them to Elsa's ice palace.

In the late afternoon, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf arrive at Elsa's ice palace. Sven waits at the bottom of the stairway leading up to the front doors, as his feet can't get a grip on the icy steps. Meanwhile, when they get to the front door, Anna tells Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced Elsa to a guy, she froze everything (making Elsa look like an overprotective sister). The dejected Olaf and Kristoff wait outside and start counting to 60 while Anna heads inside.

Inside, Anna is stunned at the glorious interior of the palace and, even more amazed, to see the new ice dress Elsa has conjured for herself. Though Elsa is happy to see Anna and quickly forgives her for the argument that happened at the coronation party, she becomes nervous and suggests Anna leave so she can't do any harm to her. The conversation is momentarily interrupted when Olaf crashes the meeting (having taken Anna's request of ""give us a minute"" quite literally). Elsa is astonished to find that her powers include the ability to conjure up living snowmen.

As it turns out, Elsa is surprised to learn that her entire kingdom is frozen, and Anna is surprised in turn to learn that Elsa doesn't know how to stop it. But Anna insists her sister's powers are no reason why they should be so distant. However, having seen Olaf, Elsa flashes back to accidentally hitting Anna in the head with her snow abilities and grows scared, demanding Anna leave.

Elsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (""For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)""). But Elsa grows so upset that she unleashes an icy chill, of which a portion strikes Anna in her heart.

Elsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (""For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)""). But Anna's promising to stand by her sister's side and help her, Elsa only grows more agitated and nervous resulting in her magic flaring. This time, a blast of magic bursts out and strikes Anna in the heart. Elsa, in desperation to get her sister to safety, creates a giant snow creature (that Olaf calls ""Marshmallow"") to throw them out.

Marshmallow deposits Anna, Kristoff and Olaf on the front steps outside the ice palace. Though he initially leaves them alone, Anna is pissed off and quickly throws a snowball at him. Marshmallow is provoked, and chases Anna and Kristoff into the woods.

Marshmallow manages to corner them at the edge of a cliff, though Kristoff immediately begins digging a snow anchor by using a rope to safely guide himself and Anna down the mountain to safety. Marshmallow, however, catches up to them, though Olaf tries to stop him (to comically little success). Marshmallow, annoyed, kicks Olaf over the cliff, and continues his chase for Anna and Kristoff. He pulls them up to his face by the rope, and screams in their face ""DON""T COME BACK!"". Anna then grabs Kristoff's knife and cuts the rope. This sends the duo into freefall, onto a twenty foot deep pile of fresh snow. With his mission to drive them away complete, Marshmallow returns to the ice palace.

As they recover from the landing, Kristoff notices that Anna's hair has started to turn white. Fearful that she may be injured, Kristoff takes her to his family...who happen to be a group of rock trolls -- the same ones that saved Anna many years before. Kristoff explains that as he had no family at a young age, the trolls took him and Sven in.

The trolls are overjoyed to meet Anna, and at first they eagerly believe that she is Kristoff's steady girlfriend, so they try to marry them in a dance number (""Fixer-Upper""), and almost get all the way through the vows before being stopped by the accidental participants. However, he tells them that she is injured and needs their assistance. Just as he did 13 years ago, Grand Pabbie comes forward and examines Anna, but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart. Pabbie cannot save her; Anna's heart has begun to freeze. Grand Pabbie says ""an act of true love can melt a frozen heart."" Anna quickly tells Kristoff that Hans can surely help, and they take off for Arendelle.

Meanwhile in the city, Hans has been providing shelter and help for Arendelle's people. When Anna's horse returns, riderless, Hans asks for volunteers to join him in bringing Anna back. The Duke of Weselton volunteers his two bodyguards, and secretly tells them to shoot Elsa if they should encounter her.

The next morning, Hans's party arrives at Elsa's ice castle. Shortly after they arrive, Hans orders that no harm is to come to Elsa. While everyone agrees, the Duke's thugs quietly disagree, still following the Duke's orders to kill her. The moment they come close enough, Marshmallow reveals himself from the form of snow boulders piled up by the base of the stairs, and jumps right into battle. The archer immediately attack the beast with their arrows, infuriating Marshmallow and causing his ultimate form to be unleashed. Marshmallow is able to hold most of the guards off. Hans, however, proves to be a fierce warrior himself, avoiding each of Marshmallow's attacks and eventually using his sword to slice the snow monster's leg off and cause him to lose balance and begin tumbling over to a large gorge. With Marshmallow wounded, Hans begins heading inside Elsa's castle. Marshmallow, however, doesn't give up, giving one last swing in attempt to drag Hans down with him. Marshmallow fails, and plummets down into the chasm below, apparently to his death.

While Hans has been battling Marshmallow, the Duke's two men have managed to use the distraction to barge up the ice steps and into the castle, where they corner Elsa. Despite her pleading for them to not shoot, they shoot at her. She quickly forms walls of ice as shields to block their shots. Eventually, she has the beardless thug pinned to a wall by several icicles and is on the verge of using a wall of ice to shove the bearded thug off the balcony. Hans and his men show up just in time and Hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. Elsa settles down a bit at Hans' words, realizing what she's doing. The guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the Duke, aims his crossbow at Elsa's head and prepares to shoot her. Hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. The arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for Elsa's head. Elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.

When Elsa wakes up, she's back at the castle in a dungeon cell, her hands chained and encased in steel mitts. As she looks out over the frozen kingdom, Hans appears, telling Elsa that Anna has not returned, and pleads with her to stop the winter. Elsa claims she can't, and must be let go to keep others from being harmed.

Meanwhile, Kristoff and Sven arrive at the castle. Anna's condition has grown worse, a chill coursing through her, and more of her hair has turned white. Several of the castle staff escort her in; she looks back as Kristoff and Sven leave. Anna is brought to Hans and tells him that he has to kiss her in order to save her.

The castle staff in the room quickly leave to give them privacy. Hans places Anna in a chair, leans in as if to kiss her... and says ""Oh, Anna, if only there was someone here who loved you!"" As Anna looks at him in shock, Hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family's throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. Unable to get to Elsa, he made Anna's acquaintance and played on her naivete. He intended to marry her before causing some form of ""accident"" for Elsa that would clear his path to the throne.

However, given Anna's current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab Elsa, ending the eternal winter. Anna tries to stop Hans, but he extinguishes the fire in the nearby fireplace before locking her in the room. It is then that Anna collapses, her hair now completely white.

Hans goes to speak with the duke of Weselton and several other dignitaries. He claims that Elsa has caused Anna to freeze to death, but before she died he and Anna recited their wedding vows. This apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare Elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death.

The palace guards go to Elsa's cell, but are detained when a wall of the cell collapses. While they are held up, Elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, and then breaks through the wall to the outside.

Meanwhile, far from Arendelle, Kristoff and Sven are trekking away when Sven urges Kristoff to go back. Kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at Arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. The two then take off towards the growing danger.

Olaf has managed to find Anna in the locked room, and seeing her freezing, quickly lights a fire in the fireplace. Anna explains that Hans wasn't her true love, and that Olaf should leave or he'll melt. However, the little snowman says he will not leave her side until he finds an act of true love that can save her. As they talk, Olaf recalls how Kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. Olaf goes to close it, but in the distance he sees Kristoff and Sven charging towards them.

This gives Anna hope. She realizes that they're in love: maybe Kristoff can save her. Olaf helps her up, but in the hallway, ice springs up to block their path. Going out a window, the two slide down the castle's steep roofs. Anna attempts to make her way across the icy fjord, with Olaf close behind. However, as the wind picks up, Olaf is blown away, and Anna finds her hands are turning to ice. Even so, she continues to move forward, calling out Kristoff's name.

Meanwhile, Hans has found Elsa wandering the ice of the fjord. Thinking he's come for her, Elsa tells him to leave her alone, and take care of Anna. Hans lies and says that Anna was killed by Elsa's magic. The pain of this causes Elsa to collapse, the snow in the air suddenly hanging in stillness.

The clearing of the whiteout enables Kristoff to see Anna, and he runs to her, but as Anna looks around, she sees Hans about to stab Elsa. Even with her own life at stake, Anna rushes in front of Hans, blocking the knife. As she does so, her frozen heart finally consumes her, turning her into a statue of ice, and shattering Hans' blade.

Kristoff and Sven arrive seconds later. Seeing Anna turned to ice, Elsa breaks down in tears, hugging her sister. No one is sure what to say, when Anna's icy form begins to change and gain color, and she returns to normal! Anna broke her own spell: saving Elsa was an act of true love.

It is then that Elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. And with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. Olaf is found, and before he can melt, Elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat.

In the aftermath, Hans is taken back to his kingdom by a French ambassador, who promise to see he is punished for his attempted regicide. The duke is as hotheaded as ever and tries to play the innocent victim. But remembering that he sent two men to kill her, Elsa issues a decree to sever all trade with Weselton. To piss the duke off even further, she tells the messenger to call his duchy ""Weasel Town.""

Meanwhile, Anna makes good on her promise and replaces Kristoff's sled. She also tells him that Elsa has appointed him the castle's official ice deliverer. Kristoff is so grateful that he kisses her. If he wonders why a queen who can conjure ice out of thin air needs ice deliveries, he keeps the question to himself.

Having come to grips with her powers and learning they can be a blessing and not a curse, Elsa uses them to create a wintry spectacle in the summer sky. She also turns the castle's courtyard into an ice rink, where she informs Anna that the gates to the castle will never be closed again. With the city's people in attendance, the sisters skate around the rink, happy that they are finally together again.

After the credits are over, we cut back to Elsa's ice palace, where it's revealed that Marshmallow survived the fall after Hans cut off his leg. Wandering through the empty ice palace, he finds the tiara that Elsa tossed away during ""Let It Go"", and puts it on his head, smiling to himself, and the spikes and fangs on his back quickly retract.

*Synopsis*  
In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.

Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.

A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.

As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello. Sullivan (Matt Damon) is warmly welcomed onto the State Police force by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg).

Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), whose extended family has considerable ties to organized crime, also attends the police academy. Before he graduates, he is summoned to a meeting with Queenan and Dignam who intimidate, bully, and verbally harass him. They pressure him to disqualify himself as an officer because he's too smart to be a cop and because of his family's ties to crime. When Costigan stands up to their hazing, they change tactics: they offer him a job as a police officer on one condition: that he quit the academy, serve serious time in jail on a trumped-up assault charge, and infiltrate Costello's organization. Only Queenan and Dignam will know that Costigan is working undercover. They promise him a bonus when he completes the assignment.

When Costigan gets out of prison, he contacts his cousin and tries to finance a drug deal. Costigan and his cousin meet Mr. French (Ray Winstone) at a local bar, where Costigan orders a cranberry juice. The guy on the bar stool next to him asks Costigan if he is having his period. Costigan smashes a beer mug over the man's head and is halted in his assault by Mr. French. Mr. French warns Costigan that he is not allowed to beat up certain men, and he's lucky the guy at the bar is not one of them.

Eating at the counter of a store like that in which Sullivan originally met Costello, Costigan confronts two Italian mobsters from Providence extorting protection money from the store owner. He beats the two men up badly, breaking his hand when he hits one of them. Costello learns of Costigan's actions and summons him to a meeting. He offers to protect Costigan from the Mafia, who, he promises, will return with reinforcements to kill Costigan. He invites Costigan into a back room where he instructs Mr. French, a senior member of Costello's crew, to check Costigan for weapons or a wire. Mr. French breaks Costigan's cast open and Costello beats Costigan's broken hand with a shoe, trying to get him to confess being a cop. Costigan withstands their beating and is accepted as a legitimate crook by Costello.

Both Sullivan and Costigan gain credibility within their respective organizations. Sullivan visits a crime scene where the two Mafia men from Providence are found. Sullivan contacts Costello, who directs him to influence the investigators away from Costello.

Sullivan begins dating psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Costigan also sees her but as a client, required under the terms of his probation. He also develops an attraction to her. During a deal to sell stolen missile guidance microchips to Chinese government agents, Sullivan warns Costello of the police operation and everyone avoids police detection by boarding boats waiting at the back of the warehouse.

It becomes evident to both Sullivan and Costigan that there is a mole in each other's organization, though not their identities. Costigan talks to Dignam and threatens to leave but Dignam tells him to come up with evidence so they can find the mole. Extremely agitated, Costigan relents. He has coffee with Madden who is moving in to live with Sullivan.

Costello tells Sullivan to find the ""rat"" among his crew. Sullivan asks for his crew members' social security numbers and other ID so he can track them down. Costigan searches for the informant and learns from a member of Costello's crew that Costello is an FBI informant, explaining why federal prosecutors repeatedly fail to indict and arrest Costello. Costigan visits Queenan at home late at night and tells him that Costello is an FBI informant.

Mr. French collects everyone's social security numbers and other ID. Costigan corrects Fitzgibbons's (David O'Hara) misspelling of 'citizens' on the envelope containing their information and then leaves. He visits Madden at her apartment, where she is finishing moving out. She tells him she is moving in with Sullivan. They talk and then have sex.

Ellerby puts Sullivan in charge of the investigation to find the mole in the Special Investigations Unit, citing his ""immaculate record."" Costigan follows Costello to a porn theater, where he sees Costello meet with and give a dark figure--unknown to him, Sullivan--the envelope containing Costello's crew members' personal information. Costigan chases Sullivan out the emergency exit of the theater and through Chinatown but neither man learns the other's identity.

Sullivan tells Costello to trail Queenan to a meeting with Costigan. Costigan gets away before Costello's men throw Queenan off the roof, landing at Costigan's feet. As Costello's crew leaves, Costigan joins them, pretending he's just arrived to join them in the assassination. Delahunt (Mark Rolston) is mortally wounded. Back at their bar, Delahunt fingers Costigan as the mole but dies before he can tell anyone else.

A news report reveals that Delahunt, a crew member, was an undercover cop. Dignam is forced to step down from the police force as a result.

Using Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, and fails to persuade him to quit his work as a mole. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Costello was an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He worries that his identity as a mole for Costello may be revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is traced by the police to a cocaine pick-up, where a gunfight erupts between his crew and police, during which most of Costello's crew is killed. Sullivan confronts the wounded Costello, who admits he is an occasional FBI informant. Sullivan shoots him multiple times. Sullivan is applauded the next day for having killed Costello by everyone on the force.

In good faith, Costigan comes to see him, seeking to get his civilian identity restored and to collect his back pay. He tells Sullivan he intends to resume his civilian life. Sullivan leaves to look up Costigan's employee record when Costigan notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk. Costigan finally realizes Sullivan is Costello's mole. Returning to his desk, Sullivan realizes that Costigan has figured out his true identity, so he erases Costigan's employee records from the police computer system.

Madolyn tells Sullivan she's pregnant, but doesn't reveal who the father is. A few days later she receives a package in the mail from Costigan addressed to Sullivan. She opens it to find it contains a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Sullivan walks in as she is listening and tries unsuccessfully to assuage her suspicions. He contacts Costigan, who reveals that Costello recorded every conversation he had with Sullivan. Costello left the recordings with his attorney, who has given them to Costigan. Costigan says he wants his civilian identity back or he will implicate Sullivan. They agree to meet on the roof of the building where Queenan died.

When they meet, Costigan catches Sullivan off-guard and handcuffs him. As Costigan had secretly arranged, Officer Brown (Anderson) appears on the roof as well. Shocked to see Sullivan in handcuffs and held at gunpoint by Costigan, Brown draws his gun on Costigan. Costigan explains his actions by revealing that Sullivan is the mole. Costigan asks Brown why Dignam did not accompany him, but Brown doesn't answer. Costigan leads Sullivan to the elevator and Brown takes the stairs to follow them.

When the elevator reaches the ground floor and the doors open, Officer Barrigan (Dale) shoots Costigan in the head. When Brown arrives, Barrigan kills him too. Barrigan reveals to Sullivan that Costello had more than one mole in the police and that Costello was going to give both of them up to the FBI. When Barrigan momentarily turns, Sullivan shoots him in the head. At police headquarters, Sullivan concocts a story to protect himself, identifying Barrigan as the mole and recommends Costigan for the Medal of Merit.

At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan and Madolyn stand by the grave. Sullivan attempts to talk to her, but she ignores him. As Sullivan enters his apartment, he is met by Dignam, who shoots and kills him.

7qrxct,1516104864,nvda,Possibilities for an accessible Tomb Raider game for mainstream gamers with no sight,"This is my first time posting on this sub, so I believe a little context is in order so that this post can make a little more sense to those unfamiliar with the possibilities afforded by mainstream console technology:

I am a gamer with absolutely no sight whatsoever.  As a result of never having had any sight, I've never actually played a Tomb Raider game myself.  I remember though when I was far younger, watching Tomb Raider being played around me and enjoying what I could get out of it, namely the humour of the player not being able to make certain jumps and having to go right back to the start of the level (if memory serves).  I am mostly known for playing Killer Instinct, [here's a tutorial showing the basics of how that works without sight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THbVXGulDUE), but I've also played Halo 5 and Gears of War 4, beating both with the assistance of co-op partners via Xbox Live.

Navigation of the main Xbox One interface (including store, Xbox live messages, the guide etc) is facilitated by Narrator on Xbox One, Sony's efforts to achieve a similar goal of adding afccessibility to the PS4 are way behind where they should be, given that the functionality is actually locked behind at least a region restriction if not a hardware one as well.  Microsoft's Narrator on Xbox One can even be used via region switching if it isn't available in your country and you speak one of the available languages (I can't find a definitive list of where narrator is available but if I do I'll edit it in here).

The facilities to make games accessible on consoles exist through not only solid audio design, but also through Microsoft's Speech Synthesis API (MSSA for short from here on out), which hooks into the same systems that power Narrator to allow for spoken menus and in-game UI elements.  No game has utilised these functions yet, but it is hoped that developers will do so in the near future given that they are aware they exist.

PC accessibility is also possible, with Skullgirls (a 2d fighting game) being fully accessible out of the box, due to its use of the Tolk screen reader abstraction library.  This library hooks into screen readers (pieces of software that allow for text, buttons and other elements to be rendered as spoken text) and conveys the game's information to the user, such as what option they're on in a menu, how much damage a combo has done to their opponent in training, or what they have to do during a tutorial through synthesised speech.  In fact, I am typing this post using such a piece of software, the free and open-source NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access).  The Tolk functionality was added to Skullgirls later, after the developers were contacted directly asking if they were willing to add accessibility for gamers with no sight to a game that was definitely able to be improved if the developers were willing to assist.

Now, to the actual subject matter of this post.  The idea I'm about to pitch to you might seem slightly ridiculous, but I'll provide some context to it first as well:

As much as there are mainstream games like fighting games that are playable to varying degrees even with a total lack of sight, there are also audiogames that are played solely with sound alone (though limited graphics have been used to add additional atmosphere in certain cases).

There have been attempts to translate the puzzle finding, platforming adventures of Tomb Raider, through a couple of different projects, none with the Tomb Raider name attached for easy-to-understand copyright reasons.  However, with mainstream gaming tech the way it is, I could really see both a modern accessible Tomb Raider game and a port/conversion of the original titles from the 90s being possible, if developers are willing to assist with these efforts.

Yes, this might require working through gameplay mechanics and issues piece-by-piece, but I'd hope that the assistance that would be needed could be found amongst the Tomb Raider community and developers who can understand the importance of mainstream gaming accessibility.",1

7qsjhc,1516111908,mcd,Unpopular Opinion Time,"Feel free to vote down, this is just my two cents:

Our Defensemen aren’t the problem, it’s the system. Our top 6 Defensemen are actually (in terms of talent) probably a top 10 unit. McD (though poor this year) and Shattenkirk are good players and skjei has elite potential, though looks meh this season. Smith, contrary to AV belief, is a decent second pairing guy and Holden is also a serviceable NHL player. Staal is whatever and we’d never hate him if he was being paid market value (2m ish). 

No matter what players we have our d is still shit. This is genuinely a tactics problem. 

Feel free to argue, I actually just want to figure out how to fix our team. ",1

7qtson,1516122915,mcd,I thought he was my best friend...,"This isn't the usual post you see in here, but this is a safe place and I need to let it out, so I'm posting it here...

Short back story on me: Disfunctionnal familly, co-dependant mom, alcoholic dad with strong N traits when he drinks(LC), was intensely bullied at school which resulted in effects that lingers even today. I have done a LOT of healing however, and though there's still work to be done, I'm (mostly) a functionnal adult.

Now, two years ago, my mom got me a job as a dishwasher at her workplace. I'm officially in Agriculture, but seeing as I live somewhere with huge winters, I needed something for the off-seasons and it does the job. I made a friend there, let's call him Argo. Argo is the son of one of my coworkers there, though he works in a different section than we all do. He's a HUGE nerd(which I also am), so that was a big plus. He is also, however, someone who went through a lot of the same things I have(disfunctionnal familly, bullying) and I personally believe the best friendships are made between people who can understand what the other people have/are going throught. So we started bonding.

And it was great! We got along extremely well, he and my bf got along very well as well. We joked, played game, shopped... My bf and I really value our friendships, and he's not quite where I am in his healing process, so we did our best to be there for him. When all of his tires ended being deflated at -30c and none of his long time 'friends' would help him, who went there with all of the tools and a compressor? My Bf. When he was sick as a dog, who got him rehydration solutions? Me. We did plenty, without ever asking for anything in exchange, without any second thoughts. Because he was our friend. MY BEST friend, and we both cared for him.

Then came yesterday... I ended up being stranded in the city after work, with no way to get back home. I don't have a car myself, the bus system is absolute crap, and my bf's car wouldn't start. I did all I could to pass the time while my bf tried to start the car. Went to a nearby grocery store to buy things, went to eat at McD(I hate McD, but it was the closest restaurant to the grocery store). Hours pass, still nothing.

Well, Argo lives really nearby. Like, less than 5 minutes by car of where I was. Surely he'd be able to help me, right? I asked him. I'm stranded, can you please come and get me? I'll hang out at your place until my BF manage to come get me. He can't, he's eating. That's fair, people need to eat. So I wait. Surely he'll call to check on me once he's done eating, right? I mean, that's what normal people would do.

Unknown to me, my bf also tried to ask him, later on. Trying to explain the situation, that he was really worried, and he wanted me to be somewhere he knew I would be safe rather than some random McDonalds. And Argo spent the entire evening making excuses. He was still eating. He was doing laundry. Meanwhile posting his meal on facebook(chicken croquettes and sidekicks noodles), posting about how he was wondering what game to play...

I had been stranded in the city for HOURS, I was stressed up and tired, my bf was worried sick about my safety... Meanwhile, my LANDLORD, once he came home, spent half an hour in the freezing cold trying to start my bf's car, even offering to come pick me up. We live 20 minutes by car away from where I was stranded. He was fully willing to take over an hour of his time to come help us. And my BEST FRIEND couldn't take 10 minutes away from his laundry to help.

Now, you remember how I mentionned Argo's 'friends'? Argo always complained about how he did everything for them, whenever they needed help, or money, he was the one they went to, but they were never there for him when HE needed them. Basically, he was their doormat. Well, I understood once I got home. That's exactly what I was to him. A doormat. Someone who was there for him when he needed, but he could ignore when it didn't suit him. 

The difference is: I may be caring, I AM NOT a doormat. I care, I give, but I have NEVER let people walk over me. And HE will be no exception. But I'm heartbroken. I've always had trouble making friend, I can't begin to describe how much joy this friendship brought me. I was beginning to feel like a normal person, not like an hermit who stays home all the time with more pets than is socially acceptable. And while things will never be the same, I still care. I know he's not a Narc, that he's got so much potential as a person... but if his fleas are so extensive, I seriously don't think I would ever be able to help him.

I'm still considering what I will do. Should I keep him as a friend, but stop pampering to him? Confront him? Just cut him out? There are pros and cons to all options. I don't need to make a decision right now, so I'm just taking my time to relax. Hopefully time will bring the answer...

7qx9ak,1516151061,mcd,I’m scared,"I’ve been unemployed for a while. When corporate interviews led nowhere, I hung out a shingle and started consulting. It pays really well, but I haven’t had enough client volume to make it work. Eventually, savings ran out. Family — my dad — made me an offer to stay, loan me money until I either found work or my client volume ramped up.

So I retargeted my focus and am applying to every headhunter and opening in my field, plus openings one level above and below mine. I’m shaking all the trees for client work and have some bids out. And I have an online part time job that just started.

But. Apparently my dad didn’t tell his wife what he’d offered me. She found out and is angry at me. I don’t understand that part of it — why she blames me, and why he wouldn’t tell her — but that’s how it is. There’s a lot of dysfunction in the dynamic on this side. Drinking, screaming, unhappy people all around. If I’d had anywhere else to go, I would have said no.

Things have been getting worse here. They scream at each other every night — I work in another part of the house with headphones in — and I’m not welcome to eat here. Well, according to Dad I am, according to his wife I’m not. She’s the one home all day. They used to invite me to share supper every night, but Have stopped. I have a separate apartment here — think mother-in-law suite — but no food. I’m rationing five eggs, a jar of peanut butter, four oranges, and some ramen, rice and oatmeal packets. I’m pretty good at rationing food. And they invited me to share supper last night, so I had a real meal.

I’m really scared that I’ll be kicked out tonight or in the morning. It’s below zero even during the day this week, we’ve had snow, I don’t have a car here and it’s an area without Uber or shelters. My cell phone is past due and will be disconnected in the next day or so. I’ve been hoping a check that’s supposed to be enough to cover the balance will arrive before then. My bank account is overdrawn and I have $60 in cash.

I think my plan is to just bundle up as much as I can, stuff my laptop and some interview clothes in a backpack, and...I don’t know. Find a Walmart or something that’s open 24 hours that I can not freeze in. Maybe walk to a McD when it opens and work there at my online thing. Work on finding a shelter or place to sleep tomorrow night. I don’t know. But I’ll figure it out.

I just needed a place to type this all out and get it out of my head.",0

7qxd9d,1516152097,aapl,Beginner's Guide to Picking Stocks: Step 5 of 10.,"Sorry, I have been slacking for a while. I am still getting back into the groove after the long break.
As always, you can read this on my [blog](http://stockmarketnoob.com/2017/10/30/step-5-of-10-what-is-the-companys-revenue-cash-and-debt/), or read it on Reddit.

**Step 5 of 10: What is the company’s Revenue, Cash, and Debt?**

Revenue can found in a lot of different places. If we go to Morningstar.com and search for the stock symbol AAPL you can see the last 10 year worth of total revenues under key ratios.

However, you can’t see the revenue breakdown in Morningstar. If you want to see the revenue breakdown by sectors within the company you have to go to the annual report. It is a bit tedious, but sometimes you can find some pretty interesting information.

In 2007, around the first release of their first iPhone, Apple made about $24,578 Million or $24.578 Billion. In 2016, Apple made a whopping $215,639M in revenue!! That is an annual revenue growth of 24%!!! That is crazy. However, in the last 5 years, they have only grown their revenue at 6% – 7% annually. A company can’t grow at 24% forever because that means the entire world will be owned by Apple.



If we look at the 10-k, Apple breaks down their revenue between iPhone sales, iPad sales, Mac sales, Service, and other products. We should look at how much each product represents how much of the company’s total revenue. This is important because just because we think a certain product is great and if that product only represents a small portion of their total revenue, then that product will not move the needle very much.


Apple also breaks down their revenue by country so you can take that data into consideration.

In 2016, Apple Revenue Split:

iPhone represents 63% of revenue

iPad represents 10% of revenue

Mac represents 11% of revenue

Service represents 11% of revenue

Other products represent 5% of revenue

Apple's Revenue (NYSE:AAPL)	2016
Total Revenue	$215,639M

iPhone Sales	$135,852M

iPhone as % of revenue	63%

iPad Sales	$21,563M

iPad as % of revenue	10%

Service Sales	$23,720M

Service Sales as % of revenue	11%

Other products	$10,781M

Other products as % of revenue	5%


I did this for 2016, but you should do this for 5-10 years worth of data.
Now, let’s look at how much cash this company has and how much debt they have. The reason for this is that during a downturn if the company has a lot of debt and no cash they may go default on their loans and potentially go bankrupt. It is harder for companies to go bankrupt if they have no debt.



At the end of 2016, Apple’s Cash &amp; Cash Equivalent Position = $245 Billion
At the end of 2016, Apple’s Debt Position = $83 Billion
So at the end of 2016, Apple has a net cash of $245B – $83B = $162 Billion


Apple's Cash &amp; Debt (NYSE: AAPL)	2016
Cash &amp; Cash Equivalent	$20,484M

Short-term assets	$46,671M

Long-term assets	$170,430M

Total Cash &amp; Cash equivalents	$237,585M

Short-Term Debt	$0M

Long-Term Debt	$78,927M

Total Debt	$87,927M

Net Cash. Cash - Debt.	$158,658M


You don’t have to find debt and cash load for the past 10 years since the amount of cash and debt usually only matters when you buy the company.
For the most part, it is better companies to have a lot of cash and low debt. If you subtract debt from the cash/asset balance that should either be positive or have enough free cash flow to pay that back within 3 to 5 years. I don’t feel comfortable with buying a share of a company if they can’t pay off their debt within 3-5 years.

**TL; DR**

Find company’s total revenue and revenue break down for 10 years.

Find company’s total short-term &amp; long-term debt.

Find company’s total cash or cash equivalents.

Find company’s net cash balance. Cash – Debt.

The company should be able to pay off their debt within 3 – 5 years. Any more than that will be a bit too much.

7qzazg,1516172806,mcd,Japan Food Reviews - Meguro駅前McDonald's,"&gt;MEGURO EKI MAE MCDONALDS

At Meguro I step off the inner circle of the Yamanote Line and my impatience is printed clearly on my face.  Enough so that some small lady in jean shorts &amp; black stockings jumps out of my way I as trudge forward eyes downcast to the platform stairs.  Actually, she probably would have done that anyway.  Is it racism?  Whatever, I can't be bothered to consider the opinion of some Christmas cake who wears the legwear equivalent of white socks &amp; sandals.

The original plan had been to conduct the review in neighboring Gotanda, then flit over to the east side of the station just in time to catch the new shift of talent as they came in.  With my weak-kneed demeanour and terrible language skills I'd still be paired up with the crypt keeper but at least she wouldn't be sweaty yet and I'd be less likely to hear something along the lines of ""your my 5th foreigner today!"".

But there is no McD's in Gotanda!  The only Yamanote Line station without one!  That's an automatic point deduction for Meguro already and we haven't even gotten there yet.  If that doesn't seem fair fuck you welcome to Japan.  **(-1 point)**

The Meguro McD's is located at the JR exit on the otherside of a roundabout.  You have to use a small crosswalk after leaving the station.  It's so small you could practically jump it, and there's hardly ever any traffic.  Yet dozens of native sheeple stand there blindy waiting for the light to turn ""BLUE"".

Confident in my upbringing as a sentient, free-thinking individual I buck this rediculous social custom and cross anyway, casting a smug wink at some OLs standing across the way.  A taxi then materializes out of nowhere and comes to a screeching halt just inches from my man-bag so filled to bursting with multiple versions of the same pointless document that it probably could have absorbed the shock of impact.  A quick blip of the horn and a glare from the driver leaves me wildly embarassed.  No amount of headbanging and karate chopping an invisible speedbag in front of my face eases the shame.  So far so bad Meguro McDonald's **(-1 point)**

Finally arriving, the line to order is out the door and uncomfortably close to the line for the bus.  It's already bad enough I can feel everyone's piercing gaze about my choice of meal (""sasuga foreigner, it can't be helped he needs to eat Mac, anywhere else is just too difficult!!"") but now I've got to put up with being near the subhumans who reject the train masterrace.  What awful planning on the store's part **(-0.5 points)**

I order some seasonal bullshit menu item written in kanji by pointing at it, and the cashier has the gall to retort with ""nomeemono wa?"" instead of the much more formal and direct 「セットのドリンクはこちらのリストからお選び下さい」.  To bring them down a notch I say ""coke"" under my breath but am disgusted when my choice is understood completely.  Fucker must have taken a school trip overseas, uppity cunt. **(-1 point)**

I proceed to the 2nd floor eating area and look for a seat that will allow me to stare at the legs of someone sitting across the room.  I find the perfect target -- a well-fed OL with an above-knee skirt and terrible leg discipline.  She's sitting toes splayed outward and knees a good 3 Strong Zero diamater apart, like she's on a Mario Cart game machine.  Emboldned by such sloppiness, I pretend to drop my cell phone in order to get the proper viewing angle.  It makes a terrible clatter and draws a few glances but was that a flash of color I saw in the darkness between two chubby, stockinged knees??  It's too risky to use the phone again so I throw my mystery sandwich on the floor and go for another look.  However, across the room the gateway to zen snaps shut and I look up in time to see the OL glancing away from me in obvious disgust / embarassment.  Very unprofessional service **(-1 points)**

Unable to eat the floor sandwich (6秒 already passed) and frankly too embarassed to stick around I dump everything in the wrong trash bin and power walk out of the store, the pronounced way I slam my heels down first drawing stares from everyone.  All in all, a very poor showing indeed.

7r2pdb,1516210848,mcd,2018 Carolina Panthers Draft Profile,"Good Morning Panther fans,

As the winter storm smashes most of the southeast, I hope you're all enjoying the fluffy snow, the twinkling ice, and the bitter cold that keeps most of us inside.

For those of you not in the southeast, I'm sure you have great weather wherever you are.

Anyways, for Panther nation, today is a snow day.  A day that comes usually maybe two to five times a year for North Carolina, igniting fear and panic across the state, forcing Carolinians into finding their local grocery and ransacking it for every drop of milk and crumb of bread to be found.

Now for some of us, we were lucky enough to wake up to an email from our respective daily responsibility, whether it be school or work, to stay in from the inclement weather due to dangerous roads.  Some of us, its just another Wednesday with some fluffy shit on the ground.

Whatever your situation may be, snow days are perfect for one thing: Football.

I loved playing football in the snow when I was 'younger.' Playing with friends in the park, bundling up in an old Panthers hoodie and beanie, feeling cold and wetness in areas that you've truly never experienced, and eventually ending the game because it was 11 touchdowns to 10 touchdowns cause nobody can run or tackle in 4 inches of snow.

Fast forward to my current life as a college student and since the season is over for our beloved Panthers, this snow day is perfect for this: D R A F T S C O U T I N G

Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be taking a position of need for Carolina and breaking down a couple of draft prospects.  Maybe some late round guys, first round guys, and everything in between.

~~**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**~~

**Offense:**

~~--------------~~

To summarize the needs for the Panthers offense mostly depended on the choosing of a new offensive coordinator.  Now that we know Norv is the guy to rejuvenate the offense, there are a couple of key things to remember with this offense (assuming he runs a similar style here in Carolina).

When Norv was most successful in San Diego he had a couple of things:

* Athletic TE who was basically treated as a big wide receiver
* Big WR able to make plays with his body down the field
* RBs who can catch out of the backfield/slot but can also power through the holes
* Offensive line who can protect long enough to throw down field 
* A QB not afraid to sling it

Not all those pieces are foreign to this Panther offense.  In fact, I'd say they have a lot of those pieces in place.  But I do feel that there can be additions, or at the very least improvements, individually to help the offense out tremendously next year.

**1) Offensive Tackle**

Now, I'll be the first person to say that Matt Kalil was not the worst thing to ever happen.  To be quite honest, I thought he was serviceable.  The problem with Kalil this past year wasn't health related, it wasn't a lack of understanding and honestly, it wasn't a lack of production.  The problem with Matt Kalil is that when the offense needed a play to be made, it seemed like the defense would target him as the weakness and attack.  We saw that against the Saints when Cam Jordan had his way with Kalil, a.k.a (to Jordans amusement) Speedbump Mcgee.

With Norv Turners offense up in Minnesota, Kalil struggled.  Like a lot.  So much so that Vikings fans rejoiced at his departure last year.  Why did he struggle? I'll get into that more when I breakdown the draft position (and honestly when I get done watching more tape) but seeing Norv walk back into the office probably made Kalils balls shrink into his gut.

**Is the answer on the roster?** Well I, as everyone on this subreddit would agree(mostly) would love to see Moton take a snap or two over at that LT position.  Whether its because he was a rookie last year, the money was invested in Kalil or what-have-you, we didn't get to see that.  When he was brought in as the sixth offensive lineman, and from his work in preseason, he was a very solid player and showed great potential and growth over the season.  

**What I'd like to see in the draft:** Obtaining a guy who is ready to play from day one.  Whether this is a first round pick or a second round pick, I think it is imperative that the Panthers go and get more depth on the offensive line as well as more athleticism at that tackle position.  Versatility isn't bad either.  I'd like to see a guy who could slide inside in the case that Norwell were to walk.  I should really change the title from Offensive Tackle to Offensive Lineman, but regardless, the need remains the same.  

**2) Running Back**

In San Diego, ol Norv had a Hall of Famer that he could design his offense around.  Ladanian Tomlinson, for those of you unaware, was by far the best running back in the league for a stretch of time.  He scored 28 rushing touchdowns in one season, 31 total from scrimmage.  That took place in 2006, and Norv wasn't a part of the team then, but you see the kind of talent he had when he was there.

The Panthers have Christian McCaffery, a guy who we all know isn't known for running between the tackles, but has great hands, is a great route runner and in the playoff game showed his game breaking speed.  He needs a partner in crime however and with a running back class as loaded as this one is, there is potential for acquiring a game changing bruising back to change the pace

**Is the answer on the roster?** According to Mike Tolbert, who played under Norv during his stint in San Diego, he believes that a guy like Cameron Artis Payne could step up and be a guy to produce. This is assuming that Jonathan Stewart is on his way out, after having a down year and being 31 by the time next year starts.  Now CAP has had some opportunities, most recently in the Week 17 shitshow in Atlanta where him and Cam weren't on the same page with some exchanges.  Add to the mix Fozzy Whitaker who was hurt most of the year, and you have a collection of guys who are solid, with CMC being the outlier.  

**What I'd like to see in the draft:** I'd love for Carolina to get a true Running Back.  Jonathan Stewart was a 'true' running back for a lot of his career and I think the style he plays with is perfect for this offense (I just think hes hit that wall).  With this being a deep draft class, I think there is potential in the second or third round for a really solid guy who could come in day one and play for a spot in the rotation.  If Norv is going to continue the ground and pound style with a stretching play action pass game, running back has to be a need going into this years draft.  If some other positions turn into stretches for round one, I wouldn't mind seeing them spend pick number 24 on a RB as well

**3) Tight End/Wide Receiver**

I know, I'm kinda cheating by putting two separate positions here but hear me out for a moment.

I love Greg Olsen.  He showed why he is a difference maker from the second he came back from his broken foot. And to come back from a broken foot to be that difference maker should tell you everything you need to know about him as a leader of not only the offense but this team.  But by the time the draft takes place, Greg will be 33, not ancient in any case but not a spring chicken.  Coming off that foot injury, which could still require further treatment this offseason, I think it'd be the perfect time to go get another pass catching/do it all Tight End

Now the reason I put these two positions together is because out of all the positions this team needs, I feel like the WR and TE position have the highest chance of being Free Agent acquisitions.

Hurndog said it himself, this team needs more speed and said that can come by way of free agency or the draft.  Free agency is still a little ways away, but before we find out who re-signs with who, remember that Carolina needs to spend some coin on some other places, like resigning Norwell.

**Is the answer on the roster?** At the WR position, I think yes.  Curtis Samuel was showing signs of being a really solid WR last year before his ankle injury.  Keep in mind that the game against the Dolphins was only the second game after the KB trade and if hes able to hang on to the catch in the endzone that messed up his ankle, Samuel was en route to a break out game.  He has the size this team needs, the versatility and I do think he has the ability to stretch the field.  Factor that in with Byrd and I think there are some key pieces on this team to address that WR position.  Of all the positions the Panthers can improve on, I don't think they need to spend a first round pick on a WR. 

At the TE position, in simple words, no.  Outside of Olsen, Manhertz nor Dickson offer much of a threat in the pass game.

**What I'd like to see in the draft:**  Keep in mind that there can be some really good talent at the WR position in later rounds.  Its always a deep position in the draft, but it always has one of the highest bust rates as well.  I think picking up a big WR in the 3rd-5th round region would be great, and that same range can be used for the TE position as well.  A lot of really good TE can slip into that mid-round region and with another couple years left in Greg, I think you can afford to get a guy in a later round to spell him at that position.

~~**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**~~

**Defense:**

~~--------------~~

Defense has always been a staple in Carolina, especially ever since Ron took the job back in 2011.  The Panthers over the years have fielded some great defenses and this years defense was on track to becoming another one of those great defenses.

But over the second half of this season, it all seemed to kind of fall apart. In fact, over the second half of this season Carolina allowed more passing yards and more big plays than any other team in the NFL.  It was bad.  Blame playing good offenses or good QBs but what we saw in New Orleans on Wild Card Weekend was not an aberration: This defense was above average at stopping the run, bad at stopping the pass.

At the defensive coordinator spot, it appears Wilks will be returning, but nothing has been confirmed yet.  If Wilks is the guy, then he either needs to cut back on the blitzes, coach up the DBs a little harder or acquire the guys to get this defense playing the way that he wants them to play.  

Theres one position that I think everyone can agree on as the biggest need across the entire team, but there are some other positions I feel could help this defense tremendously.

**1) Safety**

I try to not be too dramatic about things but when it comes to the Safety play in Carolina, it may be some of the worst Safety play in the league.  And if its not the worst, it is by far the least athletic Safety group in the league.  In a division that has Julio Jones and Mohammed Sanu receiving passes from Matt Ryan, Mike Evans and Desean Jackson catching passes from Winston, and Drew Brees dissecting this defense year after year, you would THINK that the Panthers would address the slow plodding secondary that has plagued them for years.

This will finally be the year that its addressed in my opinion.  Hurney said himself, they need more speed and playmakers on both sides of the ball.  

The safety position has been ignored in Carolina for years.  The last Safety that I remember the Panthers drafting and actually staying on the roster was Mike 'After Dinner' Minter.  He was drafted in 1997 and is now 44 years old coaching the Campbell Fighting Camels football team.  Thats how long its been.

**Is the answer on the roster?**  Well, I'll let your ability to decipher from context clues tell you what I think.  Kurt Coleman has been serviceable, but this year especially, he has lost a step.  Two years ago during the Super Bowl run, he seemed to get an interception every game, but he benefited by having an All-Pro and a potential Hall of Famer on the outside with Norman and Tillman.  Byrd is used goods and Mike Adams seemed to be out of position even more than Coleman.  A plea to the Panther Organization: STOP GETTING RETREADS FOR SKILL POSITIONS (plz)

**What I'd like to see in the draft:** I'd love for Carolina to use a first round pick on a safety.  Theres talent there for guys to slip into the 3rd, maybe the 4th round, but the Panthers need a playmaker back there.  When you look at great defenses around the league, look at their safety play.  There is a reason the Seahawks were great: Earl Thomas.  Theres a reason this years Vikings are great: Harrison Smith.  It doesn't matter if its a SS or a FS, just get a safety.  Please Carolina.  I can't take another season of bad angles and misdiagnosed plays.

**2) Defensive End**

The Panthers pass rush this year was kind of the opposite from Matt Kalil.  Sometimes they'd disappear during the game. They'd have lulls and be streaky, but when the Panthers needed a big sack, there was always the ageless wonder in Julius Peppers there to make a play, or Mario Addison to dig in and get a big stop.  

But moving forward, again, when you have a division with great QBs and great passing games, you need to get after the QB, something the Panthers seemed to struggle with at times last year.  It seems that the Panthers have to work hard to get pressure by sending extra guys more times than not.  Success on the defensive side of the ball starts with a strong pass rush with 4 down lineman, something G-Man used to preach.

**Is the answer on the roster?**  Assuming that Peppers doesn't come back you're left with Mario Addison, Daeshon Hall, Bryan Cox Jr. and Wes Horton.  While these guys aren't terrible, Cox and Hall are unknowns and Wes Horton is really better off in run defense.  I think this could be a position found in free agency.

**What I'd like to see in the draft:**  A pure pass rusher that has the ability to consistently get after the QB.  Now DEs are a position that takes time to fully flesh out. Mario Addison was a guy that took time to develop and has been a quality starter for the last couple years.  But with all positions, I'd love a guy maybe in the mid-late rounds that maybe Pep could mentor and take his time to progress.  Out of all the needs this team needs, DE may be one that is addressed in FA.

**3) Corner Back**

James Bradberry and Darryl Worley are two guys that are an enigma.  One week they look great, aggressive and playing their proper assignments.  Other weeks, they look confused and soft and are getting worked all game.

But sometimes it takes three years.  I heard a long time ago that its not fair to judge an NFL player or coach until about year three.  In year three of the Cam/Rivera Era, this team one the NFC South and had a first round bye.  So this theory holds true.

Having another year of Wilks under their belt may be beneficial.  Going from Sean McD's system to changing to Wilks from year one to two is an adjustment for any player, much less a reactionary position like the CB position.

**Is the answer on the roster?** With BB and Worley, theres Corn Elder who didn't get on the field at all next year, so essentially he'll be a rookie next year as well, a rookie who had a years worth of studying film and being in an NFL system.  Hes an unknown but could be a spark in a rather dull DB group. Seymour saw his play time diminish quickly towards the end of the year and with all the drama surrounding Captain Munnerlyn, I'd be surprised if he stays around another year.  One guy that could be a sleeper and a contributor down the road is Ladarius Gunter.  He came in during the WC game in NoLa and played with more fire than Worley or BB all season.  Could be a guy in camp that could be a solid depth player

**What I'd like to see in the draft:** I'd love to see Carolina get deeper and more physical at this position.  Corner is a weird position for me cause I'd love to see them take a high round draft pick for a guy, even though I'm not ready to give up on BB and Worley.  If Carolina went out and got a physical athletic corner with active hands, I would not be upset at all.  This is another position, similar to DE that I could see Carolina addressing in FA as well. 

~~**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**~~

Let me know your thoughts, I'd love to hear any feedback.  Maybe some guys to check out at certain positions, maybe a position that you feel is a need that you'd like to see covered.

Next week I'll start with the top need on defense, Safety.  If you have any prospects you'd like to have a deeper analysis about, let me know.

Draft season is on of my favorite seasons.

Enjoy the snow day!

---

Stocks opened higher and appeared to begin following yesterday's pattern of giving up their early gains. Before the averages turned red, though, they gathered themselves and then tacked on gains throughout the day.

Wednesday's rally was a powerful statement from the bulls, who appeared to be out of gas on Tuesday following a resilient start to the year. The S&amp;P 500 has advanced in 9 of 11 sessions in 2018, adding 4.8%. The Nasdaq and the Dow have done even better, climbing 5.7% apiece.

**Each of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors advanced on Wednesday with gains ranging from 0.3% to 1.6%**. The technology sector, which is the heaviest group, was the top performer, finishing with a gain of 1.6%. Within the tech group, IBM jumped 2.9% after Barclays upgraded IBM shares to 'Overweight,' and **AAPL climbed 1.7% after announcing that it will make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion to repatriate cash holdings overseas** and will invest over $30 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, creating 20,000 new jobs. Apple said its decision was the result of recent changes to the U.S. tax law.

Right behind technology in the sector standings were the consumer staples and health care groups, which advanced 1.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, the telecom services (+0.3%), consumer discretionary (+0.4%), and industrials (+0.5%) sectors finished at the back of the pack. GE weighed heavily on the industrial group, dropping 4.7%, as investors continued selling in reaction to Tuesday's announcement that GE's reinsurance business will incur a larger-than-expected charge of $6.2 billion.

Meanwhile, the financial sector (+0.8%) finished roughly in line with the broader market following fourth quarter earnings from BAC, GGS, UUSB, and SCHW. All four companies beat earnings estimates, but Charles Schwab was the only one to advance, adding 1.0%. The three other financial heavyweights lost between 0.2% and 1.9%.

Among the notable gainers was JUNO, jumped 52% to $69.25 per share after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is in talks to be acquired by CELG. **BA shares built on their strength, adding nearly another 5% in today's trading of note**, Bloomberg reported that Brazil opposes a full takeover of ERJ by the U.S. plane maker, and that the country expects Embraer's talks with Boeing to resume. Among the noteworthy losers was F, which dropped 7% after announcing preliminary 2018 guidance that was worse than expected. Also lower were shares of FAST, which fell about 6% after the company's fourth quarter earnings report.

Elsewhere, the major European bourses finished Wednesday on a lower note, with Germany's DAX (-0.5%) leading the retreat, while equity indices in Asia finished mixed. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.4% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's Shanghai Composite added 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.

*Plot Outline:*  
As the Greeks fall, they decided to head back home. King Priam decides to have one last battle with the Greeks to leave Troy for good. It was a night battle so the Greeks didn't knew, raining them down with flaming arrows and lighting huge balls of dry branches and rolling them down at the beach. It was a battle that Achilles wasn't in, but his cousin Patroclus pretended to be him by wearing his armor, his sword, his helmet, and his moves. Hector finally had a battle with Achilles not knowing it wasn't him. Patroclus was fast but Hector was faster, causing him to cut Patroclus's neck and finishing him with a sword to the heart.

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Apple Inc. AAPL 1.65% said it would pay a one-time tax of $38 billion on its overseas cash holdings and ramp up spending in the U.S., as it seeks to emphasize its contributions to the American economy after years of taking criticism for outsourcing manufacturing to China.

&gt; It also will expand from $1 billion to $5 billion a fund it established last year for investing in advanced manufacturing in the U.S. All told, Apple said it would directly contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, with the bulk-about $55 billion this year, for example-coming from ongoing spending on parts and services from U.S. suppliers.

&gt; He later called on Apple to build a factory in the U.S. and last year said Mr. Cook promised to build three plants in the U.S. Apple has responded over the past year by pointing to its spending on procurement in the U.S. and to the size of the so-called app economy spawned by the iPhone, which the company says has created more than 1.6 million U.S. jobs.

&gt; The $38 billion in taxes Apple owes reflects its growth in the decade since Congress last reduced taxes on overseas holdings.

&gt; The changes in U.S. tax law triggering Apple&amp;#039;s $38 billion tax obligation don&amp;#039;t affect the company&amp;#039;s responsibility to repay Ireland &amp;euro;13 billion in unpaid taxes in Europe, according to a spokesman for Ireland&amp;#039;s Department of Finance.

&gt; The planned bonus, reported earlier by Bloomberg, adds Apple to the growing list of companies that are rewarding employees due to the new tax law, including AT&amp;T Inc. and Comcast Corp. If Apple brings home a large share of its overseas cash it could decide to apply some of it to more buybacks and dividends.

7rbanv,1516296339,tsla,AMD has removed the Tesla tweet.,"The AMDServer account previously tweeted about AI with the TESLA corporate headquarters prominently featured:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/7r5hmr/the_official_amd_server_account_just_tweeted_this/

This tweet is now removed.

I wonder why.

EDIT: Picture of the text of the original tweet:

EDIT2: I've seen this post linked to on stocktwits a few times. If it wasn't clear from what I wrote above: TSLA headquarters were **PICTURED** as the thumbnail of the tweet. The tweet text from AMD does not mention Tesla. The ARTICLE AMD linked to however, **does**. Do with that what you will.",1

Is there some software tool out there where I can input all my funds and output what my total % per individual stock would be? For example, if 5 different funds hold AAPL all at different weights, I'd like to find out what my total weight in AAPL would be for my portfolio.

I currently do this manually and it is a time burglar.

How to exceed margin limits and violate Regulation T.,"Ever think to yourself “I can’t believe my Broker doesn’t allow me to borrow more margin backed by potential future gainz.” Well I’ve got the solution for you that is sure to put yourself in a reg T call and get an angry voicemail from your brokers risk department. 

Many of the large brokerage houses allow you to place market sell orders in the pre and post market trading sessions. These orders won’t get filled till the market opens but will free up the entire position and credit your buying power. (Ex. Sell $50,000 in AAPL stock, get ~50,000 BP based on the expectation of that sell order getting filled). Now go ahead and place a buy order, get a fill in the pre market, and cancel that pesky market sell order. Boom - free $50k borrowed out of thin air. 

Next step: (1) sell that stock you bought pre market for massive gains; or (2) sell that stock you bought pre market at a significant loss &amp; wait for your broker to liquidate your account; or (3) ignore all incoming calls &amp; plead ignorance with your broker; or (4) do the same thing tomorrow.

*****
&gt; Navigant Research has compiled a new report on 19 companies working on automated driving systems, and investors may be surprised to see Tesla Inc in dead last place in the driverless car race.

&gt; Investors are acutely aware of Tesla&amp;#039;s production and distribution disadvantages compared to legacy automakers like GM, but Navigant is also highly critical of Tesla&amp;#039;s technology.

&gt; Tesla&amp;#039;s first version of Autopilot relied heavily on technology from Mobileye, but Tesla ended its relationship with Mobileye in 2016.

&gt; Mobileye has since been acquired by Intel Corp. Navigant analysts aren&amp;#039;t the first to question Tesla&amp;#039;s driverless technology.

&gt; In September, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said Autopilot 2.0 was way behind schedule and did not have the full range of capabilities that the Mobileye-powered Autopilot 1.0 had. &amp;quot;While Tesla has many advantages, we believe its self-driving capabilities are exaggerated,&amp;quot; Warburton said.

&gt; Tesla has consistently been missing production targets for its Model 3 electric vehicle, and Deutsche Bank analyst Rod Lache says GM has taken an under-the-radar lead in the AV race.

**Top 10 holdings opinion**

I did a run over of the financials of all of the top 10 investments. Overall I did not see anything negative that was worth bringing up other than I could not find a lot of info on Daifuku Co Ltd. 

**Pros/Cons**

*Pros*

Robots/AI are the future

The top 9 investments have a good chance at being the big winners in the industry

*Cons*

I could not find enough info on DAIUF to make a true choice whether this company was a good investment for the fund

**Do I believe in the fund:** Yes, I am an investor in this fund for the long run. I believe that this is one of those things you buy and ignore for 2 to 3 years before re-evaluating.

**Target Price**

I see this fund easily hitting the $50 mark within 1 year. $100 within 3 years.

I was met with some usual smart assery about how it wasn't actual dd or how I was wrong in my picks because their logic is more smarter. Psh. So basically nothing substantive that I could seriously consider.

Moving on. Here is an update to my portfolio, what stocks I held, what stocks I swing traded, what stocks I sold, what stocks I had mentioned in my previous post that were missed opportunities.

To start off: (not doing dd on them again, read previous post)

MARK: Bought in around 9.75s, then bought more at at mid 11s then a very small portion at low 13s. Started selling off when it reached high 13's.

Made roughly 30% gain on MARK. No longer own any of it. SUCCESS 

SQ: Switched this out with MJX because I thought itd be at least 1-2 months before it started going up again and wanted to make a quick buck off MJX. MJX started buying in at mid 31's and decided to sell off around 36, made roughly 20% profit when I could have made around the same with SQ if I kept it (bought SQ at 35s) NEUTRAL.

MSFT: Got impatient, sold it off because I wanted to invest the money into more volatile growth stocks. Still a good pick though. NEUTRAL.

KEM: Had someone saying this was a bad pick on the post because it was a commodity, bought in at low 15s, more at high 16s and then even more at high 16s. Will sell half before earnings, half will sell after. Up 20% so far. SUCCESS

ETP: My sell off point for this was if it hit 20 a share. Bought in high 17s sold off high 19s. 10% profit. Mediocre but still SUCCESS.

MOMO: My favorite Chinese growth stock along with BITA. Someone said to ditch MOMO in the previous thread but I said no thank you. It's been giving slow gains but I'm very confident about it. Bought in at 25s, up 10% so far. SUCCESS.

BITA: God I wish I had more money to have bought into this, this is another company I am very confident about. At one point I had bought in at 29s but kept swing trading when it hit 32s for quick buck. Bought in today at 37s again.

TEUM: Really good company with a bright future, management is doing all they can to expand business and increase shareholder value. I originally had bought in at .71 and sold at 1.35s a few months back. I now bought in 275 at mid 2.30s. I believe this can reach around 6-8$ by end of year.

Overall portfolio is up 30% since New Years

I did upgrade to Robinhood gold even more and now use 2k margin

TLDW: Original content is the strategy driving all the growth. Streaming expands to 650M subs by 2028 &amp; $100B+ in annual recurring revenue. Toys/merchandise/video game licensing is next growth avenue. Very similar to what Disney does with its IP. Eventually Netflix launches real world theme parks or experiences (think VR rooms/worlds) around its original content. Sort of like their own version of disneyworld

With a forward 2019 p/e of 47.98 P/E, it seems that they are pretty much priced for perfection. Already meeting most analysts' PT (doesn't mean too much, but hey its a datapoint)

If the price already reflects the grand expectations of the company, the upside seems way too small in comparison to the risk of them underperforming. Even if they continue to perform relatively well, how far can they run up with its current valuations? 

It seems like NVDA is currently trading under the ""castle-in-the-air"" theory (where the intrinsic value of the stock becomes irrelevant). I suppose the same thing can be said about AMZN, but look how its doing..

7rmavh,1516402738,tsla,Stockchain Global Q&amp;A with COO Eric Vogeler - Building a Better Brokerage.,"*Disclosure: I participated in the presale.*

Stockchain Global is building a blockchain based stock and financial instrument brokerage. 

I had a few questions for the team, so I reached out to them and Mr. Vogeler  gave me some great answers, and a few more details on their future plans. I figured I would post them up here for anyone who may be interested.

**Would you describe this project as Questrade on the blockchain?**

 

&gt;I think that's a good, if somewhat incomplete, comparison.  Stockchain Global seeks to bring blockchain--and all of the benefits it provides in security, disintermediation, perfect chains of title, etc.--to financial markets.  Perhaps more importantly, Stockchain's aim is to flatten finance by making financial markets of all kinds available to main street investors who may not have had the ability or capital themselves to participate.  So yes, it will function as a brokerage with a blockchain backbone, but perhaps more importantly, it could create entirely new markets for new market participants. 

 
**To what extent will your platform be decentralized?**

 

&gt;Our current plan now is to build out the platform on the Ethereum blockchain.  In that sense, the most essential features of the blockchain, including decentralization, will be brought to bear to secure, streamline, and facilitate transactions on the platform.  That said, most financial markets (and regulators, who have a lot of control over their jurisdictions) will require varying levels of custodial and fiduciary duties, including performing AML and KYC analyses on Stockchain users to verify, among other things, their capacity to participate in a particular trade.  Given that reality, Stockchain will likely have to keep at least some of its functions centralized.  (That said, the Ethereum project continues to impress and may come up with solutions that will let us continue to move toward full decentralization). Any platform looking to engage in the financial markets, which are some of the most heavily regulated in the world, will have to deal with this reality - and this is where we think that our team has a huge opportunity to lead out, given our collective knowledge and networks in these very areas.

 

**If I buy an asset, am I buying it from you, or another user of your platform?**
 

&gt;For buying and selling assets, Stockchain will be a brokerage platform that simply facilitates the tokenization, management, and trading of financial instruments.  Users will be purchasing those assets from each other and not from Stockchain.  

 

**Will I hold the tokenized assets in my personal wallet, or will they stay on the exchange? Are they set up in some sort of trust?**
 

&gt;An astute question, and one which we're working through currently.  Most likely, tokenized assets will have to remain within the Stockchain system to ensure that they are only traded as users dictate or can qualify for, primarily due to regulatory and legal requirements about who can trade what and how they can trade it.  For instance, if an LLC manages its membership on Stockchain and a member of that LLC decides she wants to sell her shares, the LLC may have certain terms and conditions that both the seller and subsequent purchaser have to abide by, and there are legal/regulatory requirements about how the sale can be done.  If the tokenized shares of the LLC are sent out into the wild as a token, disputes (litigation / chaos / etc.) would inevitably result, and it would also likely be a violation of securities laws.   

 

**If Stockchain disappears tomorrow, do I still own the assets I have purchased? How can I exchange them for their traditional counterparts?**
 

&gt;Yes.  Ownership would continue on.  Whether the tokens would have to be transferred to another platform or reduced to more traditional, written instruments (as is currently done), tokens simply represent ownership of a right or property.  In the worst-case scenario that Stockchain is somehow forced to wind up, we will have procedures in place to ensure that users are not left without proof(s) of ownership. 

 

**What’s stopping me from selling the tokenized assets to an unscrupulous individual?**
 

&gt;Well, nothing so long as that individual can pass muster on the platform itself.  But this is true of any market today.  That said, users on the platform will have to pass certain jurisdiction-specific requirements to participate in the Stockchain system.  

 

**Are you planning to use/partner with the 0x protocol, Kyber network, etc. for your exchange, or are you building your own exchange? If you are building your own, why?**
 

&gt;We may ultimately explore a partnership with 0x or another exchange, but one of our stated aims (and one of the primary reasons we have built the kind of team that we have) is to build a platform that is, itself, compliant with regulatory schemes.  Building out our own platform from scratch will ensure that we can better secure it and, together with regulators and legal experts in any jurisdiction, bake the applicable rules and regulations right into the design of the platform from day one. 

 

**Do you expect the assets to be fungible, so I could buy them on your platform, and sell them on one of your future competitor’s platform?**

 

&gt;Potentially.  Building on the Ethereum blockchain provides just that kind of fungibility.  If the tokenized assets themselves can be sent to another, similarly compliant exchange, it could be possible to arrange for a transfer from platform to platform.  That said, such transfers between custodians would have to pass regulatory muster. 

 

**Do you plan to also offer cryptocurrencies on your exchange? Do you see an ETH/TSLA (for example) trading pair at some point in the future?**

 

&gt;As feasible, we plan to allow users to transact in cryptocurrencies--i.e., ETH, DAI, (a crypto-version of the Dollar, Euro, etc.).  So an ETH/TSLA trading pair could be in the cards. 

 

**What account funding options do you plan to have?** 

 

&gt;Right now, we anticipate having jurisdictional-specific fiat currency (hopefully the cryptographic version as well at some point) as well as a handful of cryptocurrencies: ETH, DAI, perhaps BTC / BCH, etc.  Currency custodianship adds an extra layer of regulatory complexity, so to the extent we can minimize dependence on fiat currencies, the more streamlined (and secure) we can make the Stockchain Platform.

7rr36b,1516463099,aapl,Morning musings,"Good morning all. I wanted to start a thread where we can discuss some weekend happenings. You know, a corner hangout while we wait to make some money tomorrow. 

Here are some thoughts I’m having. 

***

**Bitcoin**

Strongly advancing. At $12,600 as I write this. I’m still seeing $20,000 in the cards in the next 90 days. I also believe we see $40,000 in 2018. 

Bitcoin simply needs to sort some stuff out, both on fundamental level, technological level, and psychological level. 

Lots of moving parts to this, and it simply takes time. 

I know people say this all the time, but personally I am not at all worried about the price action. BTC could go to $3k and I’m still up a lot. It could go to $0 and it would suck but life goes on. I can lose that money and be fine. I know some bought in at highs and feel differently. I’m cognizant if that. I’m aware of different risk tolerances. 

***

**The shutdown**

Literally not a blip on my radar. You all know my politics (100% MAGA with a strong dislike for Rs and Ds), and from a political standpoint I find it hilarious and sad that our elected officials seemingly put everything off until the last minute while we pay them. 

From a trading standpoint? I strongly believe the markets don’t care and won’t care and we are going much higher. 

My conservative estimate for this year was 20% S&amp;P gains, so let’s call it a target of 3250. As I said earlier, 3400 would not shock me. 

This is all about earnings and corporate taxes and repatriation of money. 

I believe we are about to see some earnings and guidance the likes of which we’ve never seen. AAPL is bringing $250 BILLION home. Think about that number. Astounding. Essentially economic stimulus from a private company. 

Look at the economy. Some of you hate Trump. That’s nice, put that aside because it will limit your gains. Take a walk down Main Street and see that movie theaters are busy, restaurants are full, your neighbor got a raise and is getting a new car, your other neighbor just got back from a cruise...it goes on and on. Things are really good. 

They are going to get much better.

Remember, the markets don’t look back, they reflect the future. They tell us where they believe we are going. 

***

**Tweet, tweet**

My birdie.  Not much I can say except that on occasion a contact reaches out to me with bits of advice and price targets. I believe he is 80-90% correct (although admittedly I have never compiled any data). I can reach out to him but he usually doesn’t respond. 

I met this individual years ago when I lived in New York.  He knows what is going on.  It’s a strange yet fun (and fruitful!) relationship. 

He told me 2815 was the target for this week. I assumed it was SPX and that’s what I told you guys several times. SPX of course fell short of that (but not by much, however if you were playing options then that several points short is a BIG deal, I get it). 

/ES however hit 2815 ON THE DOT and then reversed. 

Coincidence? You can judge it. Think of all the price action that could exist. Now think of the shutdown gibberish happening. What are the odds of /ES nailing 2815 (not 2814.75 and not 2815.25 but 2815!) as the high and then reversing. 

I don’t know, I’ll let you judge it.

What a great place we have here. It’s all thanks to /u/hibernating_brain for creating it. 

Yesterday I was fairly red in my options account (down several thousand $) and /u/mrmalfoy saved me with a great AMZN weekly call that I entered and closed out for great gains. My account turned around and I finished down less than $500 on the day. 

My point is that I didn’t see that play. He did, and I trusted his instincts because I know how diligent he is. 

It was my money and I took the risk but I suspected it would work out. 

That’s what we’ve got here. We are making a real difference in the way we trade and the way we enter and exit positions. 

As we get more traffic it’s imperative that we continue to help others learn, and also police ourselves. 

Kudos to all of you. ",0

7rwsgp,1516526086,nvda,Reminder this is r/stock and not a crypto sub; feedback welcomed.,"The reason why we have a rule against crypto discussions is because this is r/stocks where we discuss stocks.

Last year we had a surge of comments that were literally ""buy bitcoin"" in almost every single post on r/stocks, and it wasn't just a single comment, sometimes you would find 10 users stating the exact same thing, ""buy bitcoin"" or going into details on how to mine bitcoins; this is spam &amp; off topic.

Also Bitcoin is not a stock, just like discussing buying &amp; reselling sneakers is not a stock, these discussions are off topic and that reason alone was enough to remove posts &amp; comments.  Unfortunately this wasn't enough, so we created a rule (see sidebar) against discussing crypto with a link to a sub where you could; we also made an automod rule to deal with this.

If you want to discuss investing in general, you can go to r/investing, which is mentioned in the sidebar (on mobile by tapping ""about this community"").  If you want to discuss crypto &amp; mining you can go to r/CryptoCurrency.

Below is the automod message I wrote, **please give me your criticism &amp; feedback on this**.  I made it informative to deal with some misconceptions &amp; misinformation ~~(including GPU mining).~~

You can also see that when a stock is related to crypto, **I've whitelisted that stock (including this post) so you can discuss crypto** as long as that discussion is related to the stock (or this post), so it's not 100% removal; it also only affects top level comments:

*****

Sorry your comment (link to comment) in /r/stocks was automatically removed as per **rule 6:  Bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrenies should be discussed in r/CryptoCurrency.**

This probably only affects your comment if it was a top level suggestion.  **Keep in mind this is r/stocks and people come here for stock suggestions.**

We've whitelisted some discussions on crypto, but not all such as **bitcoin &amp; crypto holding ETFs and futures (explanation below)**.  However **we allow crypto discussions on the following:** Coinbase IPO, Square INC, Overstock, XNET, MARA, GCAP, NVDA, AMD, and Kodak; this list will always be updated (see below to what won't be included).

A list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)

If you're just wondering if cryptocoins are an investment, [read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/are-cryptocurrencies-investments)

**Please note:**

* GBTC, BTSC &amp; other crypto holding ETFs don't function like other commodity ETFs like USO &amp; GLD.  GBTC &amp; BTSC are overvalued, inefficient, trade on Over The Counter exchange, and unregulated.  Within a 5 day period where Bitcoins went up 43% for the week of Dec 4th 2017 while GBTC dropped 7% and BTSC fell a whopping 61% (people calling BTSC a scam is not an exaggeration).
* ~~**AMD, NVDA, VISA are not affected by bitcoins**; GPU mining died in 2013 and since then everyone has switched to ASIC mining, check for your self [with this website.](http://whattomine.com/); some analysts say only 5% of GPU sales are related to crypto mining.~~
* VISA is not affected by crypto currencies:  VISA transactions are around **$10 trillion** while we don't have a dollar value of retail crypto transactions, we have per second retail volume of bitcoin + eth = 14 per second vs VISA at 4471 per second (based on 2016, [source](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-facts-figures-jan-2017.pdf)), source for [crypto transactions.](https://cryptovoices.com/transaction-volume/).
* CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) &amp; CME Bitcoin futures are not stocks and don't affect the stock market like other commodities:
 * Oil futures affect the stock market because the energy industry depends heavily on the price of oil.
 * Price of gold, copper, steel, and other metals affect several industries &amp; their respective stocks, not to mention gold is an indicator for fear/safe-haven and affects stock indexes.
 * As of 12/2017, there is not a single publicly traded company that depends on the price of cryptocurrencies.  **As that changes I'll whitelist those specific stocks until** there's a recognized sector and I'll release the floodgates of posts.  Until then, see r/cryptomarkets, r/TheWallStreet, or r/Commodities.
*  If you're wondering if a crypto crash could affect the stock market, lets put things into perspective: Bitcoin &amp; crytpocurrency market caps are still less than 1% of the stock market at around half a trillion (12/2017) while gold is at 7 trillion, the s&amp;p at 22.5 trillion, and residential real estate at 34 trillion; not to mention bonds &amp; global real estate reduce everything I just mentioned into fractions.

Thanks for understanding.

Again this post is whitelisted so you can mention any crypto related keyword (as long as it deals with this post), and please provide your feedback which will help me whitelist more stocks/keywords; again keep in mind this is r/stocks.

**Update:**  Based on feedback I updated the bullet point regarding the size of crypto market vs stock market, thanks u/yourslice

**Update2:** Based on information provided by u/mike_996, I'm whitelisting NVDA &amp; AMD against crypto related keywords.  However I'll be making a 2nd rule that'll remove ""how to mine"" type questions w/ a message that contains links to sub reddits on mining.",0

7rzvu4,1516563205,mcd,My TOP 10 players of HUT 18,"I've done this the past few previous years and it's always a fun little topic,
what do your guys' top 10 look like?

For me it's something like:

**10. Mark Messier**

Think my first Legend card I purchased this year and he still makes my team and consistently comes up with points, real nice all-around center. 
Currently 12+19=31 in 27gp (on the 4th line!)

**9. ICE Stamkos**

I preferred Stamkos as a base card when everyone's team was a little worse but he still comes up clutch as, in my opinion, the best LW in the game. There's
really just no one who even comes close to Stammer as a righty, guy's the fastest, has the best shot and is clutch with the hands.

**8.  ICE McDavid**

Like Stammer I doubt McD needs any introduction, eventhough I play him on center I'd recommend putting him on RW if you've got the space. He plays a near perfect
offensive game with only faceoffs leaving something to desire.

**7. ICE Jamie Benn**

This was a kind of a shocker for me, recently I decided to make a team with guys i'd normally never use in any situation and my 1st line RW was Jamie Benn
and holy shit was he clutch, he's currently not on the squad before he gets some upgrades but his all around game is fucking amazing. You can even play him on C if 
you're really curious of trying him out.

**6. FB Jaromir Jagr**

Just wanted a big strong guy on my 4th line RW to play around with (since I usually prefer the small and fast on wing) but Jagr has been no joke, again, with an unreal
all-around game and his shot being his best asset. Definitely Ovechkin level stuff and his clutch levels are insane. Probably the most last minute cheeses I've had in my kah-reer.

**5. TOTW Mike Smith (90)**

This guy's been getting a bit of hype recently and it's not for nothing. Been putting up ridiculous numbers for me at ~92.47sv% rn after 10 games (I know it's going to go down
at some point but still impressive.) Really if you feel like no goalie does it for you, pick this guy up stat.

**4. ICE Doughty**

I'm notoriously bad at playing with right-handed defensemen, like there's nobody that can do anything for me except Doughty. Unbelievably fast, good shot and has almost Lidstrom
level defense (almost).

**3. Nicklas Lidstrom**

His card doesn't seem like the offensive shooter type but for some reason he hits the most d-d 1t's for me and also manages to have the best defensive game of any card. Like don't look
at the stats when you buy this card, just give him a go.


**2. Pavel Bure**

Obligatory Pavel Bure, 4 NHL games later still makes my top 3 every single time. You know he's one of the best, doesn't need any more praising.

**1. Martin St. Louis**

I can't recommend this guy more. When I was playing with my low-rated teams and whatnot I definitely missed this guy the most. He's just so good, I don't know how exactly to put
it in words but just think about Pavel Bure, on steroids. After 54gp he has put up 48 goals and 22 apples (70pts). Easily my favorite card in this HUT and close to any HUT ever. Give him a 
go.

$PGR broke out to new high  
$ADP broke out to new high  
$FTNT initial rejection then broke to new high

$HFC rejected hard on Tues, finished week red  
$RHI no new significant highs/lows, very choppy but flat  
$VRSK broke out to new high  
$OSK after a test/reject, finally broke out on Friday  
$AMN broke out key resistance on Friday, challenge of new high possible next week  
$NEWR rejected hard on Tuesday back in  
$CALD rejected on Tuesday, broke to new high on Friday  

Many of the setups through some initial testers that were rejected.  And despite the market's mini ""reversal"" tuesday, most of these have broken to new highs and have bullish near term outlook.",1

7s5h6d,1516624728,msft,"Visual Studio - ""We're actively working on a solution that should address broadly the issue of Visual Studio 2015 &amp; 2017 ignoring path selection during installation.""","There is a known issue with Visual Studio, where upon installing Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017, the install path users have selected would get ignored.

Offiical reason is given below:

&gt; @David Edell (and to everyone), 

&gt; We're actively working on a solution that should address this issue broadly - which is why we've left this item open rather than directing people to vote up a request on User Voice, as we do for most feature requests. We recognize the importance of this issue, and several members of our team have been working on addressing this for some time now to ensure a complete solution. 

&gt; The key to the solution involves adding the ability to set the paths for SDKs, which make up the bulk of the Visual Studio install size (topping 100+GB for a complete installation). Many SDKs are not produced by Microsoft, so ensuring we are able set install paths for those external deliverables and ensure the entire product works correctly is taking time to complete. 

&gt; The short-term workaround is to download large SDKs manually (before Visual Studio) and install them into your own, custom paths using each installer's UI. Visual Studio's installer can detect and use those pre-installed SDKs, and they will not be removed when you change selections in Visual Studio's installer. 

&gt; We recognize this to be a workaround and are working to present a complete solution as soon as it is ready. 

&gt; Thank you for your continued understanding and patience.

7s6mth,1516636367,msft,Do you think that MSFT and 343i can capitalize on Bungies Misteps with Destiny 2?,"First of all I want to say that obviously halo and destiny are two different games, but their is a cross section of fans who followed bungie form halo to destiny. I also know that destiny is on more platforms so its not possible to convert every destiny fan, but halo 6 will launch on PC and XBOX so that is a hefty chunk.... now on to the topic:


The issues with destiny 2 are the following.

- Lack of an engaging story
- Lack of community building within the game (ie: customs, forge, clan interaction is mostly done in a browser/app)
- Lack of competitive multiplayer modes (4v4 only)
- Unrewarding Progression
- Obnoxious implementation of micro-transactions
- Weak endgame both PvE and PvP


I believe that if the right investments were made in Halo 6's development, 343i could nail every one of those points and if the cross-play with PC is handled properly then it could really rejuvenate the halo community and bring it to new heights. heres my suggestions on how.

- [Engaging Story] Halo has always had an engaging story, I believe halo 5 was a slight misstep but based on everything 343 has said since halo 5, it seems they know it to. IMO halo 4's story and writing were excellent which shows they have the prowess. 343 in their breif exsistance as a developer has shown a history of correcting their missteps (halo 4 gameplay vs halo 5 as an example) so I fully expect them to nail the story in halo 6. 

- [Community Building] Community building has been IN-GAME with halo since halo 2, it has expanded in almost every entry since then culminating with halo 5. with its current trejectory I fully expect this to both A) launch with what halo 5 currently has and B) expand upon this to provide even deeper access to clan features. waypoint should be an add-on experience and not the main experience, like bungie.net is to destiny.

- [Multiplayer Variety] Another point where halo is already ahead of Destiny, Halo 5 launched with a pretty bare bones playlist offering (although still light years ahead of Destiny), and again 343 is on recorded talking about how they know that was not the right call. I expect Halo 6 to launch with multiple playlist that support a varying number of players out of the gate both ranked and social.

- [Progression] This would be one of the bigger fundamental changes in formula if they tried to compete with Destiny, but I believe they can. Obviously im not going to advocate to some kind of shared world shooter mechanic as I believe the linear-sandbox approach of halo needs to remain in tact but I dont think adding basic RPG mechanics to the campaign would break the magic that is halo. Imagine those Narrative elements of halo 5 where it becomes a walking simulator essentially were used as hub worlds, like destinys tower, where you could purchase upgrades with materials earned in game. Imagine if after a completing a mission a player could return to that mission area and do some other minior tasks as side quests for NPCs in those hub areas to get even more upgrades. I would advocate that the campaign be able to be completed without having to do this, but in doing so it becomes easier. that way its not forced on players but adds that experience for people who want it. At the end of it all have those upgrades be applicable to Firefight which would serve as the PvE endgame.

On the flipside, imagine if the lobby for PvP was the USS Infinity which had vendors that sold cosmetic and stat based/ effect based upgrades based on credits earned by playing. I know ""stat based"" is a red flag but im preposing they only be used in a specific game mode kind of like REQs are now. I think those upgrades should provide new ways to play and should all be OP / fun but only in a specific mode. Its important to preserve the Pure halo multiplayer as the core component of PvP. 

Finally Halo 5 offers a lot of armor options but IMO a lot of them, especially the bodies, look the same. I think 343 needs to be a bit more imaginative  when it comes to designing these, even if it means stepping outside of the scope of halo slighting... I dont think Halo Cannon is as important in PvP as it is in the campaign. Providing a ton of unique and awesome gear, both cosmetic and game-changing, unlocked via progression and not loot boxes, is imperative to creating a place where players want to come back to. 

- [Loot Boxes] First off I dont hate the implementation of loot boxes in Halo 5, I think the cadence in which you can obtain them for free is very good, if not one of the best in modern games. However I would suggest some tweaks that better align with my progression suggestion. I think anything to do with the appearance of your spartan, and the weapons they have should be removed from loot boxes. I think having boosters drop that improve your intake of credits for cosmetic unlocks is fine, I think assassination animations, or different emotes they may choose to implement is fine, or stuff like emblems, banners etc. This puts the onus on 343i to create intriguing cosmetics that players would feel enticed to gamble on obtaining instead of putting the onus on players to feel they need to buy these to unlock things that will improve gameplay for them. If this is done right we get the benefits of loot boxes (no season passes to split the community, free maps and other content) without the negatives (locking gameplay behind slot machines). 

- [End Game] This is two-pronged, I think endgame for PvP is easy to fix. You need a skill based rank (which they already have) and a progression rank (which they already have). The one suggestion I have is to make the seasonal rewards better to make players want to come back every season. for PvE, I think they could borrow a lot from The Coalitions implementation of Horde mode in gears of war, having to progress through lower difficulties to level up and become stronger/ get better gear to be able to compete in the higher difficulties adds an endgame progression that non-pvp players can get attached to. They must avoid putting any of this progression behind microtransactions though, as that is the big mistake they made in gears 4. As a pie in the sky dream, which is probably out of scope, It would be pretty awesome to add bosses with actual mechanics and not just big bullet sponges to, similar to destiny's raids. 


...phew. This ended up being a lot longer of a post then I anticipated but I am just a huge fan of Halo however I feel it lost some of its broad appeal when bungie left. With the state of Destiny 2 coupled with halo 4s multiplayer issues at launch, halo 5s single player issues at launch and MCCs network issues....I think MSFT has a great opportunity to win a lot of those players back. 

If you managed to make it to the end, thank you for reading. what do you think about the points I made above? ",1

I like that I can order and pay from my phone, but when I get to the restaurant and I have to speak my phone code to a person, then I have to see the person at the first window, whose only job is to offer me a paper receipt (!?!?) then I have to see a third person to get my actual food.

Here's how to improve:

1. I don't need to tell my code to anyone. The computer knows exactly where I am and why I'm there.

2. Pull directly to the last window, skipping the first window for the receipt.

3. A robot arm slides out and hands me my food. No human contact whatsoever.

When we are eating fastfood, we are in a state of self disgust and pity, etc...I resent the fact that I need to interact with someone whilst I'm in that state of greasiness.

Uses the usual stats table to roll against, and also provides those random events prompts. 

I’m happy to provide the live bot or the source if it’s legal to do so. Mythic has been really useful for me, so I want to help introduce more people to its uses. I also have a mobile-friendly web version of the same, if it’s ok to release that. 

Edit: of course, if you haven’t already, buy the [Mythic](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator?term=mythic++game+master+&amp;test_epoch=0&amp;it=1) pdfs on DriveThruRPG, it’s cheap and way better than just worth it. 

Edit 2: [Here's what each Mythic decision engine looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/XTAAO)

Edit 3: Here's the request I sent Word Mill, will update once they have a chance to respond: 

Good morning, I recently discovered your Mythic Game Master Emulator and constructed Discord bot, HTML/Javascript, and Excel versions of the yes/no engine (screenshots: https://www.reddit.com/r/mythic_gme/comments/7sbnul/anybody_want_to_use_a_mythic_gm_discord_bot_or/).  Before allowing access to them by the public as free GM tools, I need to seek your permission first.  I will respect your wishes with regard to copyright, licensing, etc.

Thank you for these fantastic tools!  If you decide that it's ok for me to put these on the web/Discord chat service, I will include a clear Word Mill copyright notice and direct links to DriveThruRPG.com for your products.  If you decide it's not ok for me to post these tools online, I'll only use them personally with my own gaming group.  

Either way, thanks again for designing these!  The GME is worth every penny and I'll soon be buying your other PDFs as huge timesavers and creativity sparkers.

Kind regards,

Burger King is my go-to for value... I mean, how can you beat 10 nugs for $1.49? Plus I get coupons for 10 nuggets and a large fry (I sub onion rings) for $3. That's a whole meal. They aren't as crispy as McD's but I think I like their sauces better.

Wendy's nuggets are the crispiest if they're fresh, and they have a fine flavor, but I never go to Wendy's just for nuggets... It's the 4 for $4 all day. Especially since they brought back the Double Stack. Also, I suggest screwing the fries and sub a cup of chili. Get that protein!

The swag bag was provided by Coda Signature. Inside is a box of chocolate truffles, a few body oils, and a pain relief bath bomb; unfortunately each is labeled with Does Not Contain THC/Cannabis.

The day was kicked off by Vivien Azer from Cowen, their senior research analyst specializing in the beverage, tobacco, and cannabis sectors. Ms. Azer was the first senior Wall St analyst to cover the cannabis sector, and when Cowen started their coverage in December 2016 they were the only Wall St firm in the space.

I'm taking notes for y'all and will throw something up later, but some quickies to get us started:

1. Ms. Azer currently covers **LEAF** and **WEED**. Comparing their financials is ""A Tale of Two Cities"" - MedReleaf has very healthy &gt; %30 EBITDA margins, whereas Canopy (by strategy) has an expanding magnitude of loss. 

2. Her ""Outperform"" rating is based on viewing these companies in a hypergrowth light, even with their recent crazy share price appreciations. She mentioned companies like TSLA, LULU, and MNST.

3. For the cash strapped, cannabis is a great value proposition - ""good buzz for your buck"".

4. Sessions hasn't been disruptive to the valuations. Stocks were on a massive run in the days before the news, and profit taking was in order.

5. No concerns (yet) about importation, say from Latin America. The Canadian government wants to maintain regulatory oversight.",0

&gt; Apple quietly killed off its 11-inch version of the Air in 2016, but new reports suggest that the time has finally come for its bigger brother.

&gt; Gizmodo sees this as the death knell for the MacBook Air, as the MacBook has so far only shipped in a 12-inch size, and the new panels are intended for a bigger version of the MacBook that would replace the Air in Apple&amp;#039;s laptop lineup.

&gt; Apple wasn&amp;#039;t immediately available to comment on its MacBook plans.

&gt; The 13-inch Air is currently the most affordable laptop that Apple sells.

&gt; Starting at $999, it&amp;#039;s about $300 less than a MacBook, and your only Apple computing option for under $1,000 that isn&amp;#039;t an awkward iPad with a keyboard case attached.

&gt; It would make sense for Apple to kill the Air and replace it with a cheaper MacBook option with a Retina HD screen and modern internals, but many will likely miss the razor-thin form-factor of the Air, which ushered in an entire category of &amp;quot;Ultrabook&amp;quot; laptops competing against it.

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

7sjve0,1516760283,mcd,Bring Garlicoin to McDonalds,"Hi, ik the title sounds ridiculous for some people but we can see it as it is : garlicoin will have a real monetary value. And with how much people there is on this sub I'm thinking that we can all act as one. All using everything we can to try to make McDonalds accept Garlicoin. Ik it sounds crazy and McDonalds is a corporation, but, let's face it, it would be a big publicity stunt for McDonalds and they could reach more users. 

**1st step :** We need to bring in the most people in this idea as possible, the more the better.

**2nd step :** Spam every place like twitter or reddit with post telling McDonalds to accept Garlicoin.

**3rd step :** McDonald HAS to say a yes or a no at one point if we're enough, and if it's a yes then we made it, else we still get a major publicity stunt for Garlicoin and still helps.

4th step(opt) : Buy McD's with Garlicoin.


Ik it looks like a simple model and I'm just a dude sitting there but as a community we're stronger, if we get just a couple thousands people telling McD's to accept Garlicoin we're probably going to get an answer. That's why all I can do is share this idea for possible issues in my model, but all we have to do is believe that we can because WE CAN ! AND TOGETHER WE WILL CHOOSE THE USE OF GARLICOIN, MIGHT IT BECOME ANOTHER USELESS MEMECOIN OR AN ACTUALLY USEFUL MEMECOIN REIGNING ON THE MEMERACE FOR AGES. Please take into consideration thanks.

TOGETHER, WE ARE STRONGER,
TOGETHER, WE RISE,

7sk441,1516762637,tsla,TSLA---can someone explain this for me?,"TSLA MC: $59B; Revenue: $7B in 2016. $4B in 2015 with net losses of ~&lt;$1B

Ford MC: $47.5B; Revenue $150B in 2016 with Profits: ~$4-5B?

One company is engraved in American society, and in some foreign countries. The other has based it's company on groundbreaking mode of transportation....but why is TSLA more valuable than F? Is it the promise of a ""electric"" future? 

I'm not even complaining that TSLA has net losses. If that wasn't the case, I'd think something was off on accounting or something. 

One company sells way more cars...the margin and ""electric car credit"" can't be worth that much can it?

7slpz8,1516782498,mcd,A Brief Guide to Some Training-Related Podcasts,"Here's a quick overview of some podcasts, the first lot related to training, the others some people might like also.

[The Jugglife podcast](https://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/the-jugglife) - Chad Wesley Smith and Mr Max Montana Aita talking weightlifting, powerlifting, and other stuff like the Mighty Ducks movies . Very good podcast, probably the one I listen to the soonest when I see a new episode of all of these.

[Power Athlete Radio](http://powerathletehq.com/) - 10 year NFL vet John Welbourn along with Tex McQuilkin and Luke Sommers - great podcast with a lot of information on training for athletic ability rather than just strength. Known as '***the*** premier podcast in strength and conditioning (ing)', because they keep saying it so it must be true.

[Iron Radio](http://www.ironradio.org/) - Drs Lonny Lowery and Mike T Nelson, and occasionally Dr Jon Mike, along with strength coach and '300kg squat on two replaced hips' - Phil Stevens, with occasional guests. Solid info, regular news on research and other developments.

[Ice-cream4PRs](http://icecream4prs.libsyn.com/) - Jeff Nippards podcast, excellent, full of information. Some of the best discussions on specific topics, Jeff has a few round-table podcasts where he invites a bunch of people on at a time to debate a topic. Very in depth, focusing on research rather than anecdotal evidence for the most part.

[3DMJ podcast](http://www.3dmusclejourney.com/category/podcasts/) - 3D Muscle Journey are a bodybuilding focused podcast, with some great information from Eric Helms, Jeff Alberts, Alberto Nunez, Brad Loomis and Andrea Valdez.

[RTS podcast is also good, Mike Tuchscherer and co.](http://reactivetrainingsystems.libsyn.com/) - kinda hard to listen to the audio on this one, but the topics are excellent and information is good IMO

[Barbell Shrugged](https://www.youtube.com/user/FITrTV/videos) - focused on crossfit, but there's good information for everyone in this one.

[Mark Bells Powercast](http://supertraining.tv/category/podcasts/) - some really solid episodes with well known strength guys, other episodes are more about poop than anything else. Mark Bell, ~~Silent Mike~~ and Jim McD, along with a guest usually.

[Sigma Nutrition Radio](http://sigmanutrition.com/podcasts/) - excellent podcast with Danny Lennon, originally focused on nutrition science but he realised mostly gym bros listen to it, and has got more strength related and training related guests on lately, while still having some great science based episodes on nutrition minutiae.

[The Doc and Jock Podcast](http://docandjock.com/) - Recently found this one, pretty good so far, again crossfit focused.

[Strong Talk with Kalle Beck](http://startingstrongman.com/strongtalk/) - Strongman stuffs, I enjoy this podcast for a different view on training rather than the very powerlifting focused reddit subs.

Also Kevin Oak has just started a podcast, on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KevinOakOkolie) (Kevin hasn't really kept up with this, but there's a couple episodes)

[RX'd Radio](http://rxdradio.libsyn.com/website) A couple of chiropractors (not the back cracky kind though, these guys actually talk sense rather than woo) who actually lift, one a crossfit coach, one a very strong powerlifter who trains with Dan Green.

7sm8s3,1516790300,mcd,School days.,"Oh man. You guys talking about your high school love storys brought back my ptsd flashbacks of how many times I missed opportunities to live a normal happy life. Not just one. Not just twice. Not just three times. But four. And for a kid back then, I never realized it until my friends and people around me were talking how the girls felt when we were talking about my childhood. 

First one, right? I was 11. Elementary? Sure. Innocent crushes? For damn Sure. 
How was I supposed to know? All I asked to my girl classmate who kept following me for some reason was, if we could both eat at McD's when were were going home and our parents where there picking us up. 
Mom said yes. Her mom said yes. We did go. And after that, we became playmates until they had to move because their dad got a new job abroad. I never did ask her last name, but her name was Kim. 

Second one, I was 12 years old. Moved to the private school my Grandmother works at. Day mom took me there for my first application after moving, since mom had to move out because dad cheated. 
So I was at this big private school, starting summer, and the school was empty while workers there are preparing for the next semester along with my grandma. 
This girl, who out of nowhere, I saw her playing around the outside court. Stupid kid that I was, I ran up to her and asked what she was playing. Turns out, she hurt her foot. Here's the thing you have to know. I was born and raised as a fat fuck. I have some strengths that normal kids at my age couldn't do. I didn't know what I was thinking at the time, but I picked her up and carried her on my back to the nurses' office on that hot summer day. Thankfully, the staffers are still there. After that, we became partners in crime and played around this hugeass empty private school with no other kids but only adults. 

Day after day, visiting grandma, through the entire summer, we played. 
Not once, did I ask her for her name. I don't know why exactly. But she did ask for mine. never crossed my mind to ask anyone's name. I think I was mentally scarred, because I didn't know why I never tried or even crossed my mind to ask what her name was. But after that summer, we never met again. 

or maybe we did. I never actually knew. After 2 years later of going to school there, I couldn't recognize her face, so I never even knew if she was there or not. 

Now here's the stupid part. 

In all my years of being in that private school, out comes the third and fourth encounter. I still was a dumbfuck and have no idea what the value of being with a girl was. I was 14, and never socialized that much, so I treated everyone equally. Male, Female, I tried making friends, but I always say the dumbest things because I don't know how to talk to people. Then, I met these guys. One black friend, I made friends with. Then I met this asian dude, who has the sickest latest pokemon in the circle. Then, I met the last buddy, a short pasty stack. Pale as a ghost and his skin was soft and squishy like you would if you imagined what would a glue would look like in human form. 

We formed this weirdass posse of ""the boys"" and basically having a blast. Then there's this one girl that I noticed a lot recently, even after lunch. Her skin is pale and smooth. Her face exudes beauty, and she's calm and composed. She was the homeroom president. Always that loner type. I tried to ignore her, but like an arch rival, she somehow keeps popping out of nowhere, even though we never talked. It bothered me so much that one day, while the boys were out and playing, I finally asked her what she's doing in the places I've been. Well, current in. And turns out, she just wanted to be alone in lunch. Stupid me, didn't even realize that while I was exploring, the thing I used to do as a kid with this girl back in summer, were places that are quiet with no people and dangerous, like some parts of the place were still being constructed like the gym. 

I explained what I was doing there, and hurried off. But I stopped and looked back, and saw her looking at her lunch all alone. Something in me snapped. And even though I wanted to run away from this person who may or may not kill me or scold me for being a shit, I walked back and sat next to her. I said I got tired and pretended to sit back and relax and looking at the clouds. I asked her name. She said Diana. We talked for a bit, and when the school bell rang, we walked back to the classroom. All while talking about family happenings. It doesn't end there. Because right AFTER that, I noticed this small girl, who looked like she was too young for the classroom, being played keep away by my boys. The President doesn't do anything about it and just sat on her chair, so I walked up and told the guys to cut her some slack. She's short and tiny. Got her bag and gave it to her. Turns out, she's a transfer student that just got moved mid term. For a while, I couldn't care less about who she was, just some kid who was in trouble and basically forgot about that incident after a while. We never talked, but I keep coming across her whenever she's being bullied. I'm not a social type. So you can imagine the tallest fat kid in the classroom isn't someone to be messed with. I'm just a nobody who keeps seeing this midget in trouble. I tried to ignore it at one point, but no one seemed to help her, even though she's calling out for help. They thought it was some kids playing around. And it is, but she was small and got worried. Eventually at some point, I bothered to ask for her name. It was Dorothy. On our way back to the classroom. 

Me, Diana, Dorothy and the boys were pretty chill as a circle and became a group at that time. 
Eventually, what all friends eventually end up, we drifted apart. 
I left out some stories here and there, like at some point, Diana wanted to sit in my leg. I didn't ask why, I just thought it would be fun. So I tried to make it entertaining and shook my leg up and down. It's a bit embarrassing now that I think about it, but at the time, we were kids, and I was pretending to be a car... Fuck, I'm retarded for even thinking that. At the time, I just wanted to make something into something fun. Idk, I was stupid and wanted to make people smile. Then Dorothy came and saw Diana bouncing on one of my legs and asked if she could join. And I just let them. In hindsight, I didn't think there was anything behind the reason why they asked that, I even asked one of my boys if they want to join in the car ride fun. Clearly embarrassed, he declined. God, I was a fucking idiot... 

After that, we separated after the whole school thing ends.  Mainly because most of the parents there are rich fucks with a job that can pay for it. And when their parents get a promotion, they move out. So my friends moved out one by one the high the grade we went. 

After that, Never bothered to try and make friends ever again. After a while, great grandfather died, and so goes my life as a nihilist. Nothing becomes permanent in this world, and I was an idiot to let go of ever chance that was thrown at me.﻿",0

7sncbp,1516803336,mcd,Keto diet in a country filled with carbs and sugar?,"A brief context - do bear with me. In 2016, I went through a breakup. In 2017, my employer wound up and I am out looking for a job. I have mortgage and am in an expensive city (can't move in the short term). I don't know how to cook. So, I either get microwaveable items from a grocery, eat-out at cheap places (small restaurants, food delivery services and to a limited extent McD) or do a combination of these. I also skip breakfast and do not drink sweetened beverages. I have epilepsy and am aware that the Keto diet is good. So I'm a newbie here.

I am 200 lbs, 5ft 8in. My goals are to drop 25 lbs (175lbs) by mid April and around 10 lbs by July and maintain that.

My problem is that I rarely get 'healthy' food around me, let alone affordable. Rice, noodles, fast food, sweetened coffee (that's a thing), margarine, vegetables cooked in a lot of oil are all around. 

I went through many options below but I struggle to make most of them. I realize I need to cook my food myself, and my non-vegetarian intake is only restricted to eggs and chicken.

Does anyone in the community have any advice please?

&gt; Reuters) - After missing the critical holiday shopping season, Apple Inc &amp;lt;AAPL.O&amp;gt; has jumped into the voice speaker wars with the HomePod smart speaker, a device that will use its Siri voice assistant and compete against offerings from Amazon.com Inc &amp;lt;AMZN.O&amp;gt; and Alphabet Inc&amp;#039;s &amp;lt;GOOGL.O&amp;gt; Google.

&gt; Apple said on Tuesday it will start taking online orders for its HomePod smart speaker on Friday in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, just over a month later than initially planned.

&gt; Apple is working to keep its Siri voice assistant relevant in the face of competition from Amazon&amp;#039;s Alexa and Alphabet&amp;#039;s Google Assistant, both of which are featured on smart speakers from those companies.

&gt; Apple also is counting on HomePod to boost subscriptions to Apple Music and block the rise of rival Spotify.

&gt; The smart speakers from Google and Amazon let users give voice commands to play Spotify but Apple Music does not work on the rival devices.

&gt; Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, said he&amp;#039;s concerned that Apple has focused the HomePod too narrowly on playing music with high quality sound.

**Wall Street went on a roller coaster ride on Wednesday as investors tried to extend the new year rally, but struggled to justify further gains.**

Stocks got off to a good start with the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq up between 0.4% and 0.7% shortly after the opening bell. However, the bears took control about an hour into the session and pushed the major averages into negative territory; at their worst marks the day, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq held respective losses of 0.4%, 0.5%, and 1.1%. 

The Nasdaq was the first index to move into negative ground as profit-taking pushed the index down as much as 0.7%. The Dow weakened and ultimately crossed into negative ground as well, but by the afternoon the blue chip index moved back into the green and drifted in a sideways fashion from there. In the end, the Dow finished higher by 0.2%, closing at a new all-time high, while the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Today's loss breaks a three-session winning streak for the S&amp;P 500, but the index still remains solidly higher for the week (+1.0% WTD) and for the year (+6.1% YTD).

Heavily-weighted sectors like financials (+0.7%), health care (+0.3%), and consumer discretionary (+0.4%) did relatively well on Wednesday, but the underperformance of the top-weighted technology space (-0.9%) kept the S&amp;P 500 in check. TXN was the weakest tech component in the S&amp;P 500, tumbling 8.5%, after its latest earnings report came in as expected, but didn't impress investors enough to justify the chipmaker's 25.0% gain over the last seven weeks. **AAPL was also weak, losing 1.6%, after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPhone sales for the current quarter may be disappointing.**

Among the noteworthy gainers was AMSC, which jumped 12% after Chinese wind turbine maker Sinovel was found guilty in the U.S. of orchestrating the theft of software code from AMSC. Also higher after reporting quarterly results were GWW and NAVI, which gained 18.5% and 8%, respectively. 

Among the notable losers was UAL, which plunged 11.4% after announcing a plan to boost capacity growth 4-6% in 2018 and likely in 2019 and 2020 as well. The concern is, if demand starts to slow, the airline might have to slash its prices to fill the extra seats, which in turn could fuel a price war within the industry. Also lower was PBYI, which dropped 29% after the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use communicated a negative trend vote on the marketing authorization application for neratinib. GE dropped 2.7% after reporting below-consensus earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter. 

Elsewhere, the major stock indices in Europe ended on a lower note, closing at their worst marks of the day; Germany's DAX and the UK's FTSE dropped 1.1% apiece, while France's CAC declined 0.7%. The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday, but it's expected to leave rates unchanged. Investors will be interested in ECB President Mario Draghi's press conference, however, as he could attempt to talk down the strengthening euro.

In the Asia-Pacific region, equity indices had a mixed outing with Japan's Nikkei (-0.8%) showing relative weakness. China's Shanghai Composite was the top performer, adding 0.4%.

My etf picks are very generic, VUN, VUS, XEF, VCN, ZAG, XEU, BRK.B (i know this isn't an etf but seems well diversified)

My other 20% of the portfolio consistents of

AAPL (50)
GOOG (5)

NVDIA (15)

I am significantly up on all these holdings, except Visa which I just bought today.

For people who were already heavily invested in the game since the start such as myself, we grinned and beared it when they changed the card system in v.42 and we adapted. I thought they had changed the card system because they had heard the feedback and were trying to make the card system more accessible. After having played with this new card system for a year now, I believe this card system has had the opposite of the intended effect due to the introduction of attribute points and gems. 

Have you ever tried to explain the card system to someone completely new to the game? It goes something like this: “Okay so first you need to know that cards are what make your character more powerful and give them more utilities. The first thing you have to do is  create a deck to play with. Your deck will dictate what cards you will be able to equip to your character while you’re playing. In the game there are these things called “Affinities” which are kinda like themes or a specific play style that you want to have. For example, the growth affinity has a lot of cards that give health and the two types of armor, so a tank would choose growth most of the time. Knowledge has a lot of cards that give mana and mana regeneration which would be good for a mage character. (Continued until you finish describing what each affinity is useful for). Every deck that you make, you have to choose 2 of the 5 affinities. Now you can only choose 12 total cards from those 2 affinites. You’ll probably want to start with the 3 cards that you want to end with (They proceed to read every cards passives, actives, and stats to tentatively pick three that they may want). Blah blah blah curving builds blah blah blah. Now that you’ve made a deck, you get to choose what gems to put in your deck. Gems are like extra stats and effects, basically they’re cards but worse, and you get gems with attribute points, and you buy attribute points with gold, which you get from last hitting minions. So you last hit minions to get gold, which you spend on attribute points, and after each increment of 5 attribute points in a specific attribute tree you get gems. There are 3 attribute trees which you can spend gold in to get attribute points. Agility is for basic attacking characters like fighters and carries; each agility attribute point you buy with gold gives you some attack speed and basic armor. Yeah it is weird to give basic armor to attacking heroes. Yeah some of your cards give you those stats but so do attribute points. Yes it is a bit redundant. The second attribute tree is intellect which gives you a little mana and mana regen with each attribute point. The last one is vitality and it gives you a little health and health regen with every attribute point.” Noob stares blankly. “Okay... right now you are choosing your gems. Gems give you certain effects like damage return, or lifesteal. Yeah your cards already give you those effects, but they’re stronger than gems. Yeah I know it’s redundant, just focus so we can get through this. Gems also give you stats, but make sure you’re paying attention because gems that have the same effect can have different stats. Also gems can give the same effect and give the same type of stats, but one could be better than the other. You can choose 6 gems in any attribute tree per deck. Yeah I know there are only 5 spots in each tree; they give you an extra one… for fun I guess. Now name your deck and your done.” The problem with this is that this isn’t intuitive for new players or other MOBA players. Other MOBAs are pretty simple; you get gold from last hitting minions, you go to the store and buy items and there is a specific upgrade path to the top tier items. With Paragon you have to get gold to get attribute points to get gems and cards. Attribute points, gems, and cards all give stats, and both gems and cards give effects. It’s just too cluttered. It’s a novel idea, but in practice it’s not intuitive at all to anyone trying to get into the game. At the end of the day gems and attribute points are just a big redundancy that can be removed without sacrificing anything. 

At the end of the day I believe that EPIC tried to fix a system that wasn’t broken and has to accept that a shop-like system just works. And this isn’t meant to be snarky or super critical, just objective. But I don’t believe that criticism without suggestions is very helpful so here what I think should happen.

* Get rid of Gems and attribute points, they’re redundant and only serve to overcomplicate things for players trying to get into the game.
* Just remove deck building altogether and give us access to all the cards in the two affinities we choose at the beginning of a match. The deck building system hasn’t proven to provide any more build variety than a tradition shop.
* Introduce a more traditional shop-like system with upgrade trees. This would require the addition of a lot more early and mid game cards or repurposing of lower tier cards that already exist. Another way to go about this is to bring universal cards back and have those be the upgrade cards. The universal cards would give stats similar to the card you are ultimately trying to build toward but not the actives or passives that the final card provides. Think of these as the lower tier items on the upgrade tree. You could even use the old artwork for the upgrades we used to put into cards in the old card system (Dire strikes, Minor Kinetics, etc).
* Change the name of affinities to decks i.e. death deck, knowledge deck, growth deck, etc. It’s just more intuitive and fits with the card theme.
* Remove or expand the 3 card equip limit and use those for active slots.

These changes will streamline the experience for new players, and welcome MOBA veterans from other games. The explanation will go more like this: “Okay so cards are what you equip to make you character stronger. You get cards by getting gold, which you get from last hitting minions and getting kills. At the start of every match you will choose two decks to play with, and those are the cards you’ll have to equip. Each deck has their own play style and effects… (explains each deck). To get better items you first have to buy their less expensive upgrades or you can save up and buy the whole card outright, though the latter is not recommended early in the gme.” That’s it. This is a lot shorter of an explanation to new players and is something experienced MOBA players will find familiar. Having an easier, more familiar system will increase retention for both of these groups of players, and will help the game grow into the giant slayer I believe it could be with a little TLC.

TL;DR read the bullet points I guess.

7szuhm,1516918346,aapl,This is what dips look like in a bull market.,"Okey dokey folks, let's get down to it.

Did you buy the dip? I did.

Now, some of us are leveraged and probably bled out a bit today. Some of us are leveraged and had a good day (I finished up $15,000 in profit on the day). But today was what it was. 

I know what when you are in the trenches it is hard to see the bigger picture. I was down thousands on an NQ position earlier today. It hurt a bit. But let's look at where things finished.

DJIA: +140.67 (+0.54).
---
SPX +1.71 (+0.06%)
---
NASDAQ -3.89 (-0.05%).
---

So yeah, the Dow went up (had some great earnings), but the other two were flat. Did you feel like they were flat? You may not have. If you hold only AAPL, you probably thought the world was ending. But this is it boys, this is what the dips look like deep in this bull market.
None of this junk where we finish -300 on the Dow 3 or 4 days in a row. None of the SPX finishing -15 points for consecutive days.

Nope, today was as good as it gets for the time being. So, above all, keep an eye on the bigger picture. These markets are going much higher. Every drawdown is simply noise, or algo trading, or some over-reaction to nothing news.

Later in the session I said that NQ would finish green. It did. I went long and reaped the rewards. How did I know? Well, NQ, for all the shit it put me through today, was in the value area the entire day. It was simply finding value. I knew that into close it would move higher. 

Did you think it would go lower? Do you REALLY think traders want to be short going in to earnings? No way, it's all noise. Ignore it.

**The ""dips"" we got today were the Dow and S&amp;P finishing at yet ANOTHER ALL-TIME HIGH CLOSE**. Consider that.

I'm long every frickin' index I can get my hands on. Long DIA calls. Long SPX calls. Holding /YM, /ES, /NQ and /EMD.

I am NOT a swing or day trader, of COURSE I realize using margin to day or swing trade is incredibly risky and a huge gamble. 

I'm talking about using SOME of my margin balance to buy and hold long term good, solid growth companies like NVDA for example.

My brokerage has a 9.75% margin rate currently, so obviously I realize I would have to earn 15 or 20% to make it worth it.

The way I see it, aslong as you use it wisely to invest long term in good companies, I don't see how it's any more riskier than taking out a business loan to start a business or to buy and flip real estate.

7t6xmw,1516994633,gme,Quick Story on how I got into and started investing.,"Bored at work so figured I'd share a quick story with everyone! 

When I was in middle school my Dad gave me a couple hundred dollars and taught me some of the basics of buying a stock. He told me I could buy any company I want and it would be a learning experience. 

Being the young Playstation loving lad I was, chose Gamestop ($GME). I don't remember the exact buy price, amount of shares, or anything, but after a few years (2-3 maybe??) I remember I nearly doubled my investment AND Gamestop did a 2 for 1 split!! I was thrilled, as I was only in high school. I remember wanting to sell it for a profit but my Dad was trying to teach me about long term investing (smart smart man). 

Despite that I eventually sold all my position in $GME for a decent profit, not the nearly 100% unfortunately. 

Now in high school I played World of Warcraft. Being the addict I was, I wanted to invest in Activation Blizzard! Used the money I had after selling Gamestop to buy as many shares of $ATVI I could at around $11. 

To this point today $ATVI is my biggest holding, cheers guys

7t7tht,1517001998,nflx,Today I made money for the 1st time as an investor,"I'm 23 years old and have been a long time lurker of /r/investing. My dream to invest was sparked when I was 13 years old. I had a man sitting next to me on a plane give me the best investment advice I have ever received. He said, ""When you grow up and make your first $10,000, take all that money you just made and invest it in a company that you believe in and don't touch it for years to come. Start back over at zero, and consider that money out of your hands from there on out."" 

Back in August 2015 I decided to use a little extra cash I had (not even close to $10,000, as I was a University student at the time) and try to invest in a company that I thought would do well in the future. I decided to buy 15 shares of NFLX at $126, because the cable industry was dying and I knew that Netflix would benefit immensely from this. Since I was a new investor, I had no idea that buying at an ATH was not the greatest idea, and from there it plummeted because of the China crash in September 2015. I held on to my position, knowing that selling for a loss was something I did not want to do or something that I could afford, either. I saw it drop as low as $86 and I was determined not to sell even though I saw many ""Analysts"" say how this stock was overvalued even at $85, with Price Targets as low as $50.

Fast forward to today, my sweet, sweet NFLX has shot up over 25% after a stellar earnings report. I sold my 15 shares today for a profit of 116%. It was hard to let go, but after nearly 2.5 years of watching this stock I can't help but feel it'll be in store for a major correction some time soon. I may be wrong about that last part, but it doesn't really matter, if it does happen then I'll be looking to get back in at a lower price. I believed in this company from the beginning, and I continue to do so.

My word of advice for anyone that wants to get involved in the stock market (younger or older) is that you should always invest in companies that you personally believe in; ones that have an advantage in their sector... But most of all, even though it has been said time and time again, patience does pay off.

Lastly, thank you to /r/investing, a lot of what I have learned came from your posts over the years. I hope to continue to be a successful investor in my future, and that might not have been the case without your help.",1

I think Im gonna hold it for a while, but I learned from Earnings Plays with options, even good EPS and beating estimates doesn't mean the stock will go up... If during the Report they say "" Next Quarter Prob wont be as good as this one because Christmas is over... "" stock could go down, so... Should I sell right before earnings report or hold fast?",1

INTC in my opinion is right at that sweet spot now, and very similar to MSFT back when it was in the mid 30s. I could definitely see INTC having a good multi year run and finally breaking out after slightly under performing last few years or so.

7t92ne,1517013593,mcd,An emotional breakdown at Walgreens and the wonderful stranger who came to my rescue.,"Today has been awful. This week, really, has been awful. TGIF is an understatement.


On Wednesday, I broke up with my boyfriend. It wasn't an ugly breakup-- it wasn't the ""you cheated, I hate you, I'm filing a restraining order"" kind of break up. It was the kind of break up that deep down you know it has to happen even though you don't want it to, but ""its just not the same and it isn't right and you've tried everything to make it work but sometimes love just really isn't enough"" kind of break up. I said goodbye to my boyfriend of 2 years/best friend of 5 years on Wednesday and to say I'm struggling is an understatement. We work for the same company. Not in the same building or the same city but I still see his face and his notes and his calls everytime I look at my screen and it is just a punch in the throat every single time. I wish I could throw myself into work, but work is the last place I want to be.


So, Wednesday sucked. Thursday sucked too. I left my job early to go to my 2nd job that I typically just work on weekends, but hey, I need money and I need to stay busy. At least at this job, my ex isn't staring me in the face from my computer screen.


So it's Thursday night after work, it's late, I cried in the shower and fell asleep around midnight. I woke up at 4 because I was too anxious to sleep well. I went through the motions-- drove to work, tried not to grind my teeth while my mind raced and our song played over the radio, and tried to think of what I needed to get done that day. At lunch, I needed to go to Walgreens to get file folders for my third job of setting appointments for an appraiser... that I've been severely slacking on because I've been so wrapped up in my feelings. #emotionsblow


I get to work, stare at my screen and plead with myself not to cry. I send the exboyfriend a message because I have no shame. It went unresponded to, which I know is for the best and I set myself up, but it hurts like hell all the same. I try to work until I can't take it anymore. I'm in emotional hell and I just want to leave.


I take my lunch early, McDonald's my first stop because there is nothing a crispy coke running down my throat can't fix for at least 5 minutes. I'm an emotional eater. I used to be 240 pounds and lost 85 a few years ago. I deny myself a lot of yummy, fried, salty, artery clogging foods that I constantly want because I don't want to be that girl again.. but F that. I want a burger and fries and a coke and I want it large and I'm going to binge eat McDonald's in my car and not give a shit because I'm sad and I'm going to do what I want.


I order. I pay. I drive to the next window. I get my coke. The cheerful McD's worker tells me to pull to the third window and wait for my food. (It was a large order. YOLO.) I'm sitting there, sipping my coke, enjoying the burn down my throat, but aware of how it's not dulling the pain I'm feeling.


Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. CRASH.


Bit my lip. Dropped my coke. Checked my review mirror and realize the lady behind me just rear ended me in a stand still drive thru line. 


WTF. I'm livid. My window is down and I'm cursing up a storm. I'm throwing my hands up in the air like a manic woman giving murder glares in my review mirror. The lady pulls into a spot. I wait for my food, obviously, and then pull in next to her. She was apologetic and sweet, swears she thought she was in park and gives me her information. I give her mine, snappy and rude, I can't seem to grasp accidents happen, and leave.


Grinding my teeth all the way to Walgreens, I park, and dig into my food. I don't care I'm covered in coke. I don't care people can see me disgustingly binging. I don't care. I eat and eat and eat. The inner obese girl I used to be is thrilled that I'm letting her eat and I don't stop. Every fry, every bite, gone. I notice a man staring at me as he gets out of his car, and I made sure he got an F you glare too. Judge me all day, no Fs given. 


The food, it didn't even dull the aching pain in my chest, the butterflies in my stomach, or the frog in my throat-- not like I remember it used to. Oh well. I'm still a responsible adult and I need file folders. I get out of my car. My white blouse now see through and covered in wet, brown stain. I walk into Walgreens and ignore all the looks I'm getting. I. Don't. Care. I'm in pain and I'm sad and  I'm mad and I'm hurting. I don't care how I look or what they think.


I get to the half aisle of office supplies. I don't see file folders. I look again. Nope. Come on, I always buy them here, a pack of 48 for $10.99. My eyes start to water.. over file folders. I get down on my knees, am I just missing them? Nope! There's the tag, all gone. ALL GONE. Who comes to Walgreens for file folders? Who?!


Then it happens. I lose it. The tears come quickly and freely and I'm just in Walgreens, on my knees, in a see through, coke stained blouse, bawling my eyes out in front of the office supplies. 


I can't help it. I'm sad. I'm angry. I'm hurting. I miss my best friend. I need file folders. The back of my car looks awful. I'm tired. I'm in pain.


I can't stop crying. It's Kim Kardashian ugly cry that seems to have no end. I have no idea how long I sat there crying to the office supplies.


I feel someone standing next to me, but I can't bring myself to look at them. I figured it was a police officer ready to haul me off to an institution.


""Miss?""


I don't acknowledge him. I can't. I'm ashamed.


""Miss? I'm going to help you up, okay? Is that okay? I don't touch you if you don't want me to, but I want to help you up.""


I nod. Snot and tears mixing on my face, running down my neck and he wraps his hand around my upper arm and pulls me up. I'm standing in front of him, but can't bring myself to look at him. I'm staring down at my shoes, wanting to run away.


I feel him wrap his jacket around me. ""You seem to have spilled a little bit, take this, it will help."" 


I mumbled a ""thank you"" between hiccups and sobs.


He bounces back and forth on his feet. I can't stop looking at our feet. ""No problem, you can keep it, it's my company's, we have a ton.""


Im not sure what to do, I'm humiliated. So naturally, I try to bolt.


""Miss? If you don't mind me asking, what's wrong?""


I finally look at him for the first time. Its the man that I gave an F you glare to earlier when I caught him seeing me binge eat my mcdonalds. No judgement on his facial expression, more like concern.


""File folders. They don't have file folders.""


He smiled. Was he making fun of me? Maybe. Probably. He should have. ""That IS a dilemma. Maybe I can help though, if you let me? Stay right here.""


He dashed down the aisle and was gone. What the F am I doing? What is wrong with me? I wanted to throw up. McDonald's was coming back full force and embarrassment was making me feel more sick. 


I don't know how long I stood there like an idiot staring aimlessly at office supplies with my facing drying with snot and tears.


The stranger came back, this time with a Walgreens bag. He hands me the bag. I apprehensively take the bag and guess what? It's full of freaking file folders.


""I carry a ton of these in my trunk for work, you can have them.""


What do I do?? YOU KNOW WHAT I DO. I start hysterically crying again. I'm a freaking lunatic.


""Miss, I have to go. I'm going to hug you, okay? You really look like you just need a hug.""


I don't know why I nodded, but I did.


He wrapped his arms around me and hugged me tightly and I hugged him back and it was just so freaking nice. This stranger, this kind, wonderful stranger gave me the jacket off his back, folders of his own, and the most comforting hug when I needed one the most.


""It will get better, it's just a bad day. You're a fighter, I can tell,"" he said as he pulled away. He smiled, turned his back and walked away. 


Naturally, I cried a little more. THEN I got in my car, zipped up my new jacket and drove away. That random stranger picked me up when I needed it the most. He didn't owe me anything. Most people probably would have called the police on me. 


With everything going on in the world today, please remember not every man is a bad guy. Not every man wants to harass you or hit on you or hurt you. There are some guys, and not only guys, but some people, who are just simply really good freaking people. I won't ever forget the man at Walgreens who helped me when I lost my mind over file folders. Thank you so, so much. Your kindness was so needed, appreciated and will be paid forward.  


Tl;dr: had a mental breakdown over Walgreens being out of file folders. A random stranger gave me folders, a jacket, a hug, and so much comfort when I needed it the most. There are still really good people in the world.

I have a variable `myExpiry` which takes the date in cell `C2` and converts it to epoch time, as well as another variable `myStrike` that pulls the strike price from cell `J2`. 

What I'd like to do is setup a function that takes these two as inputs, finds the nest that contains a matching `""expiration""` and `""strike""`, then returns the respective ""ask"" price.

Thank you for your help.",1
7tbj8c,1517041362,mcd,McD raise their price again silently.,"Their gradual increment has never been this fast. 

I'm actually quote worried about this because the price of McD is an indicator to the price of goods for the nation. 

In just in the past few years, they have increase their price multiple times.

7tbupo,1517046638,mcd,Xbox controller MCD,"Playing on controller is much more natural feeling to me but the throw and jump seem to be bound together. I just unlocked ninja mode but I'm so awkward with kb/m it just ends up being frustrating. 

I've spent countless hours on the original superhot tossing around swords and I'm really excited for this new mode. Any idea when we can expect some love for controllers? ",0
7tccrf,1517054734,gme,List of cores from KMFDManic set + their command line.,"I thought it might be helpful for those who are looking for which hmod to install to play with a specific system/game :) Hope I didnt make any mistake with my copypastas or forget a core! If you see any do not hesitate to tell me :D

**Please keep in mind that hakchi2 doesnt every file extensions**, so even if your file is compatible you should always check the command line!

For example: let's say I have a SNES rom named `Super Bomberman 4 (J).fig` and I want to run it with Snes9x2016, the file extension is supported BUT when I add it to hakchi2 the command line is `/bin/fig` and is incorrect! So I have to change it to `/bin/snes` or `/bin/snes16` or `/bin/snes9x`.

**\\*EDIT* 2-2-18**  
PSP core added.

**\\*EDIT* 1-28-18**  
Updated to match KMFDManic (1-28-18) set!

# **WEEK AHEAD: Big week for markets up next, with Fed meeting, earnings tsunami and Trump State of the Union address** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/big-week-for-markets-with-fed-meeting-earnings-tsunami-and-trump-state-of-union.html)*

*****

&gt; * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
&gt; * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

&gt; President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&amp;P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&amp;P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
&gt; More than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
&gt; ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
&gt; There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

&gt; Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

&gt; As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

&gt; We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&amp;P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**

&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

# **WEEK AHEAD: Big week for markets up next, with Fed meeting, earnings tsunami and Trump State of the Union address** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/big-week-for-markets-with-fed-meeting-earnings-tsunami-and-trump-state-of-union.html)*

*****

&gt; * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
&gt; * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

&gt; President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&amp;P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&amp;P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
&gt; More than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
&gt; ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
&gt; There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

&gt; Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

&gt; As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

&gt; We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&amp;P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**

&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

# **WEEK AHEAD: Big week for markets up next, with Fed meeting, earnings tsunami and Trump State of the Union address** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/big-week-for-markets-with-fed-meeting-earnings-tsunami-and-trump-state-of-union.html)*

*****

&gt; * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
&gt; * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

&gt; President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&amp;P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&amp;P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
&gt; More than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
&gt; ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
&gt; There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
&gt; The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

&gt; Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

&gt; As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

&gt; We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&amp;P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

&gt; Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

&gt; Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

&gt; If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&amp;P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

- 4x VWO (Vanguard Emerging Markets) @ $51
-2x VSS (Vanguard All-World ex-US SmallCap) @ $127
- 1x VTI (Vanguard Total US Stock Market) @ $147

Total is roughly $605, as I want to keep a some free cash in my portfolio as well. Expense ratios are between 0.04%-0.14%, so minimal.

Looking for your guys’ thoughts about this strategy. I’m feeling confident in the direction the world markets and US markets are heading, and I’d like that optimism to be reflected in my portfolio. Does this achieve that? Is this level of diversity effective?

7ti6gg,1517114269,mcd,Protect Her (Natsuki),"Part 3 in my four part DDLC stories. Check my profile to find the first two (Sayori and Yuri). All that's left will be Monika's. Enjoy!

Protect Her (Natsuki)

Natsuki’s House

*I sit in my room staring at my copy of Parfait Girls wondering to myself “why do I have to write these stupid poems anyway”? I get that it’s a literature club and all but Monika insists that I write them so I can “improve my writing style”. My writing style is just fine the way that it is. Poems don’t have to be overly complicated to be good like Monika’s or have all this symbolism and crap like Yuri’s. Why can’t I just go to the club and just read my mangas? Not like I can read them in my own house…*

*I quietly creep over to the door and peer down the hall. I can see the glow of the TV and know that...he’s home. I do my best to not draw attention to myself. Most girls would love for their father to show them attention but then again most girls father’s aren’t like mine. I finally arrive at the kitchen and my way to the sink for a glass when I hear the sound of heavy stomps from behind me.*

*Oh no...*

Natsuki’s Dad (ND): “What the hell are you doing in here? You better not be trying to sneak any food Natsuki. No daughter of mine is going to grow up to be some fat whore”.

Natsuki: “N-n-no daddy. I was just coming in here for a glass of water.”

*My dad simply glares at me.*

ND: “No man wants a fat cow of a woman. How will you expect to find a man if all you do is eat?”

N: “I-I’m not eating. I promise. Excuse me.”

*I quickly dart past my father, nearly spilling my glass of water as I move past him. I race back to my room and shut the door behind me. I place the glass down next to my bed and bury my face in my pillow to stifle my sobs. I don’t know why he hates me so much. What did I ever do to be cursed with someone like this for a father? Not all days are like this though. Some days are better than others and by better I mean he doesn’t recognize that I exist. It’s better when he doesn’t know I’m here. I’d rather be ignored if that’s what attention looks like. Whatever, I don’t need him. I don’t need anyone. Stupid, worthless dead beat…*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next Day (At the Literature Club)

N: “Well you’ve gotten a bit better. You still have a long way to go but you’re getting better”

MC: “Wait, that almost sounded like a compliment there.”

N: “Baka! Don’t get the wrong idea!”

MC: “Ok sorry.”

N: “Well here. I guess it’s my turn.”

*I hand over my poem to MC. He takes it and begins to read it. He has the same stupid, blank look on his face he always has.*

N: “You don’t have to like it…”

MC: “Oh no it’s not that. I really like it. It’s cu---”

N: “Don’t you dare say cute” *I glare at him. Why does everyone assume everything I do has to be cute all the time? Why can’t people just take me seriously?*

MC: “Uh, I wasn’t going to say cute. I was gonna say...uh...that I was just having trouble understanding the theme of it.”

N: “What do you mean you can’t understand the theme!? It’s not difficult to grasp! Dummy...” I snatch my poem back from him. “Go read the other’s poems”. 

*I walk away and make my way to the closet where my mangas are kept. I can’t keep these at home or else my dad would flip. “No man wants a woman who only deals with these childish things” I can hear him saying already. I sigh as I reach for my copy of Parfait Girls. I’ve already read this cover to cover several times but I don’t have enough money to buy the rest of the set. Still though, this is my favorite manga.*

*I sit down underneath the window and begin to read. I can still see the giant crease that MC caused the first few days he was here. Stupid boy. As I’m reading, I notice someone out of the corner of my vision.*

MC: “Mind if I read along too?”

*That’s right. Sayori told me he likes anime and manga.*

N: “Fine but I don’t know if you’ll like something like this.”

*Without saying anything he slides down next to me. It feels like he’s awfully close.*

N: “Do you really have to sit this close?”

MC: “Well I can’t see well if I sit farther away. Don’t worry I won’t bite.”

*I cut him a death stare. He begins to frantically wave his hands.*

MC: “I’m kidding! I’m kidding!

*We both begin to read. He’s the first person I know who’s willingly offered to read my manga with me. It’s kind of nice.*

N: “If this is boring for you, you don’t have to keep reading.”

*I look over at him and he has a very attentive face. I don’t think he even heard what I said. He suddenly looks up from the page and at me.*

MC: “Did you say something?”

N: “Uh, no.”

*We go back to reading until we hear the final bell.*

Sayori: “Well I’ll see you all tomorrow!”

Monika: “Yeah. Remember everyone to bring a poem to share tomorrow. Good work today”

Yuri: “Have a good evening everyone.”

*I quietly pack up my things and then I sense someone behind me.*

MC: “You left this over in the corner”

*I turn around and see that MC has my copy of Parfait Girls.*

N: “Oh...um...thank you.” I stuff it into my backpack and make my way to the door.

MC: “Uh Natsuki. Mind if I ask you a question?”

N: “O...k? What is it?”

MC: “Would you like me to walk you home today? I mean I wanted to talk to a bit more about the manga. If that’s ok with you.”

*I trip over my words, trying to find the right ones to respond to something like this. I can’t have my dad see him. That will just be...way more headache than I need.*

N: “Fine. If you want. Don’t get any ideas.”

MC: “Ideas? Like?”

N: “Bah, nevermind.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On The Way Home

*Him and I discuss not only the Parfait Girls manga but also others. Most of the “others” however, I have never heard of which I can only guess means they are probably all about guys beating up other guys and lots of screaming out every move that they have. I am not too surprised by this but I am surprised by the fact that he seems to be genuinely interested in my manga. I don’t know if he’s actually interested or if he’s just really good at faking it.*

MC: “And now we’re passing by my house”

*I look in the direction that he motions. I never knew actually where he lived. He lives like half a mile from me.*

N: “It looks like a nice house.”

*What follows is what feels like the longest stretch of awkward silence. All I can do is just look down at my feet and try to hope we will get to my house soon. I decide to stop about two blocks from my house. I don’t need my dad seeing him and me walking home.*

N: “Well here’s my stop. Thanks, I guess.”

MC: “Anytime. Well I’ll see you tomorrow Natsuki.”

*MC turns and begins to walk away. I wait till he’s out of sight before I continue to walk home. As I walk home I feel my heart begin to race a bit. Why though? Was it because of him? I shake my head attempting to shake those thoughts from my head. No he can’t. I can’t. I just need to get home.*

*As I walk up to my door I notice the cars of my dad’s “friends” outside. They’re probably playing poker or something. Usually when he has them over, they bet a few yen here and there. It’s kind of dumb if you ask me that he’s gambling our money but can’t use that yen to have actual food at home.*

*I make my way to the kitchen. I can hear them downstairs playing. I grab an apple and some peanut butter and go to my room. I eat my food and try to begin to write my poem for tomorrow. As I begin to think to myself what to write, HE keeps popping up in my thoughts. What is he doing in my head? Why can’t I shake these thoughts of him? I make my way to my computer to look up more cooking ideas. I find a few new cupcake and cookie ideas. Maybe the girls will like them. I wonder what MC would like his cupcake to b----WHAT AM I SAYING!? Frustrated, I close out of the browser on my computer and go back to my bed. Stupid MC. Won’t get out of my head.*

*He is the only person to ever offer to walk me home. I guess that was...I guess that was nice of him to do. After some time I manage to finish my poem. As I lay in bed staring at ceiling, I can hear dad’s “friends” leave. The familiar sound of his heavy footsteps making their way upstairs and then down the hall to his room ring out through the house. One day. One day I won’t have to hear those god awful steps.*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two weeks later (Natsuki’s House)

*Over the past two weeks, MC has walked me home just about everyday. At first I thought it would be a one or two time thing but nope. I have to admit, I have enjoyed it. I will never tell him that though. Still though, I can’t let him know where I live. Recently dad’s been drinking more than usual. The last thing I need him to see or hear is my inebriated father.*

*I look out the window and notice it’s raining outside. I make my way toward the kitchen. As I pass the living room I notice the chair my dad usually is in most of the day is empty. Maybe he’s in his room?*

*As I get to the kitchen, I reach for a cup when I hear what sounds like heavy breathing coming from...behind me? As I turn around I see...my dad. But there’s something wrong. His face...his eyes…they scare me*

N: “D-dad?”

ND: “Hey little N-Natsuki. Come here. Let your daddy get a good look at you.”

*I can smell the stench of cheap alcohol. The man smells like he bathed in the stuff.*

N: “Dad, you’re scaring me.”

*He begins to creep closer to me.*

ND: “Look at you. Grown up into such a fine woman. Come. Come. Let your dad see how much you----”

*He reaches for me but I manage to dodge him. I dart around to the other side of the table.*

N: “Dad! Stop! You’re drunk!”

ND: “Listen here! I said come here! Not get over here you ungrateful bitch!”

*He lunges again but crashes into the cabinets. I do the only thing I can do. Run.*

*I sprint out the door into the rain and run anywhere but here. I can hear my dad screaming from the window for me to come back but I can’t. I can’t go back there. My dad has done some terrible things before but this? This...I just can’t. But where do I go now?*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MC’s House

MC: “Thank you mom for dinner”

MC’s Dad: “Yes honey. Amazing as always.”

MC’s Mom: “Why thank you. Now MC, help me clear the table”

I suddenly hear several loud knocks on the door. My parents both look at me.

MCD: “Honey, were you expecting a package?”

My mother shakes her head.

MC: “I’ll go check”. I reach the door and open it. “How may I---Natsuki!?”

On the other side of the door is Natsuki, her eyes a dull red as if she’s been crying for hours.

Natsuki: “I--I didn’t know where...w-where else---to go. I----” Her voice trembles and she begins to cry more.

I quickly bring her inside. Her clothes are soaked through and she doesn’t even have her shoes. The sound of her cries alert my parents.

MCD: “What’s going on in----”

My dad turns into the living room and sees me kneeling in front of Natsuki. He exchanges a concerned look with my mom and they both wait in silence.

MCD: “MC...is everything ok?”

All I can do is look at him and back at Natsuki.

MC: “No. I don't think things are ok”. I just hug Natsuki as she cries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Weeks Later

*It’s been three weeks since I ran away from home. Since then I have managed to sneak back once to get my school uniforms but that’s about all I managed to get. I explained to MC and his parent’s what happened at home. I didn’t tell them exactly what my dad did, or should I say tried. I...I just don’t want to think about that now. MC’s parents offered to let me use their spare bedroom. I told them I would do housework and get a job so that I could pay them back but they declined. Even when I insisted they still told me no. His dad said something to the effect about how he wouldn’t feel right making his son’s girlfriend pay for a spare room. Seriously, what in the actual hell has he been telling them!? He denies he’s ever said that we were a couple or insinuated anything like that. Imagine that. Us? A couple? Just the thought of that makes my stomach uneasy.*

*Since I usually have to be home so early because of my dad, I can’t think of the last person whose house I was ever over to. Wait, have I ever been over to someone else’s house??* 

*From the time I have been here, his parents though have been nothing but good to me, even if his dad keeps referring to me as MC’s girlfriend. His dad I found out is a construction worker and his mom stays at home but she’s been having me help her cook and clean around the house. I didn’t know she was such an amazing cook! Sadly, MC never inherited any of her ability to cook. I swear the boy would set fire to water if he was left alone with a pot of ramen.*

*MC’s mother bought me a few outfits since I have had to wear either my school uniforms or MC’s clothes. I hate wearing boy clothes. When he asked what the big deal was I realized just how dense this boy was. I am a girl, not a boy! I don’t want to wear boy clothes...although, I do have to admit I like one of his hoodies. It’s really warm. I’m sure he won’t even notice it’s missing.*

*When I look at MC with his family, I can’t help but be jealous. His family is so....normal. His whole family loves each other. I wish I could have that. A family to love.*

*I sigh and make my way to the living room where I notice MC is sitting watching one of his animes. He notices me standing off watching too.*

MC: “Wanna join me?

N: “Um. Sure.”

*I sit on the opposite end of the couch from him.*

N: “What’s this called?”

MC: “Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood”

N: “Is it any good?”

*MC turns to me as if I just asked him “Is water wet?”*

MC: “You’ve never seen Fullmetal Alchemist!?”

N: “No dummy! I don’t get to watch a lot of anime…”

MC: “Oh it’s really good. Hold up I’ll be right back”

*I watch as he makes his way to the kitchen and begins to do...something. The anime doesn’t look like others I’ve seen. This one has a short blond guy with a metal arm and leg and some guy in a big suit of armor. Wait...what happened to the armored guy’s head? WAIT, WHERE’S THE GUY IN THE ARMOR!? What on earth is this anime?! Before I have the chance to wrap my head around what all I just saw, MC comes back holding a bowl of popcorn and sits right next to me.*

MC: “I’m back. Popcorn?”

N: “Uh...sure…” *It’s odd for me. I normally don’t get to have food like this. Normally I don’t get to have food period but ever since I came here, his family has been almost insisting I eat. MC’s mom even packs me food for school.*

N: “...So...do you like this anime?”

MC: “Of course. It’s one of my favorites.”

*Now that I think about it, before I moved in here, I didn’t know much about what MC liked. He always seemed to ask me what I liked and what interested me…*

*We watch a few more episodes before MC tells me he’s going to go to bed. I help him clean up the popcorn.*

MC: “Thank you”

N: “For?”

MC: “Watching that with me. As you probably know, anime is kind of a thing that not everyone looks kindly upon.”

N: “Yeah. Thank you for inviting me to watch it.”

*MC flashes a smile at me and I feel strange. I look away. Why...what the...why is my heart racing?*

N: “Well...I’m off to bed. Goodnight” 

*I quickly dart off to my room. Once I’m in my room I have a chance to calm down. What was that? Why do I feel so flushed? It’s not like I like him or anything. No, we’re just friends. He wouldn’t...couldn’t like someone like me...right? I crawl into bed but all I can think about is the time we just spent together. Bah...stupid MC...*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One week later (MC’s House)

It’s been about a month since Natsuki moved in with me and my family. I would say she’s been enjoying her time here, even if my parents keep thinking we’re a couple. Natsuki and I arrive home before my parents get home. Odd. Normally at least mom is home. I guess dad is at work late today?

MC: “Hey Natsuki, what do you want to eat? Ramen sound good?”

N: “Sure. Chicken please”.

We then hear a knock from the front door. I guess mom or dad are home.

N: “I got it.” I hear Natsuki make her way to the door. She slowly opens the door as I turn the corner.

N: “Hello, Mrs----no…”

Voice: “Hello there Natsuki.”

Natsuki slowly steps away from the door.

N: “No. You’re not supposed to be here.”

Voice: “Is that anyway to speak to your father?”

FATHER!? This is Natsuki’s dad?!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*No. No no no no no, he can’t be here. How did he find me? Did he follow us home? My body freezes.*

ND: “Aren’t you going to invite me in sweetheart?”

*I then feel something brush against me from behind. I turn to see its MC, but the look on his face. I’ve never seen his face like that before.*

*My dad notices MC standing behind me.*

ND: “And who are you?” 

MC: “You aren’t welcome here. So leave. Now.”

ND: “Well you have my daughter. If I leave, she’s coming with me.”

MC steps between my dad and me.

***Protect Her***

MC: “She’s not going anywhere. She’s right where she belongs.”

ND: “Didn’t your parents ever teach you to respect your elders?” 

*I watch as my dad looks over MC’s shoulder at me*

ND: “Heh. Put on a few pounds haven’t you?”

*My dad reaches for my wrist and tries to pull me past MC. I don’t entirely know what happened after that but all I remember is a loud thud and then my father swearing. As I look around I see my dad has been pushed back and...is that blood on his nose?*

MC: “I told you. She’s not going anywhere.”

ND: “You little shit...HOW DARE YOU!?”

*I watch as my dad rushes MC and MC does his best to stay between me and him. MC manages to get a few punches in between dodging my dad but my dad hits MC in the stomach causing him to double over and then hits him in the head, knocking him to the ground. MC is dazed from the hit so I do my best to shield him.*

ND: “I...told you...to stay out of my way boy. You only have yourself to blame...for this…”

*I watch as my dad rears his arm back for another blow so I close my eyes and cover MC’s head and...nothing happens. As I open my eyes, I hear a yell and a loud thud and then someone yelling our names. It’s MC’s mom. I look up and see why the punch didn’t land. MC’s dad had grabbed my dad from behind and literally threw him out into the yard. MC’s mom rushes over to check on MC. MC weakly gets up.*

MC: “I’m fine. Where’s dad?”

*We both step outside and see MC’s dad holding my dad up by his neck.*

MCD: “I don't know who you are but I am only going to say this once. If I ever see you anywhere near my family ever again, there won’t be enough left of you to put into a matchbox. Do I make myself clear?”

ND: “But that’s my daughter!”

*MC’s dad tightens his grip and I hear my dad yelp.*

ND: “Ok. Ok.”

*MC’s dad drops my father in the yard as he scurries away. He turns back to me and glares at me.*

ND: “FINE! DON’T EVER COME BACK! YOU’RE A MISTAKE ANYWAY! JUST LIKE YOUR FILTHY WHORE MOTHER!”

*MC’s dad’s fist clench as he slowly starts to walk toward my dad. My dad breaks out into a sprint and runs away.*

*MC’s dad walks up to MC and I. His gaze...he looks like if he looked at you hard enough, you’d burst into flames or something. He places his hand on MC’s shoulder.*

MCD: “You did good son. Now, let’s get you some ice for that eye”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few hours later

*MC explained to his parent’s what happened. I apologized for having brought all of this to their family. His dad looked at me and told me not to worry and that he’s pretty sure my dad won’t be coming around here ever again.*

*I walk out of my room and see MC sitting in his normal spot watching his anime but this time with an ice pack over his right eye. I sit next to him.*

MC: “Eventful day huh?”

N: “How can you…”

MC: “Huh?”

N: “How can you make light of something like this? You got hurt because of me. I bet your parents hate me for this” *I do my best to fight back the tears.*

*He pulls the ice pack away from his eye and places it on the table and turns to look at me.*

MC: “And I’d do it again if I had to”

N: “...dummy.”

MC: “Maybe. But I won’t let anyone hurt you. That I promise.” 

*I then feel MC reach down and hold my hand. Normally I’d jerk my hand away and call him some name but I don’t. What is wrong with me!?*

MC: “I don’t understand why but seeing your dad trying to take you away made me realize something. The idea of someone taking you away scares me. So because of that, I will do whatever it takes, so that that never happens.”

N: “MC...I...sigh. You really are an idiot.”

MC: “Yeah. But now I’m your idiot”

N: “My idiot? Wait, wait, wait, did you just...are we...did that...did that just happen? I---You can’t just unilaterally declare us a...a…”

MC: “I believe the word you’re looking for is “couple”.”

N: “SHUT UP!”

MC: “Sooooo, you don’t want to be a couple?”

N: “No, it’s not that. It’s...just….I….” *I begin to fall over my words. I can’t even think clearly right now. I can feel my face getting redder by the minute.*

*MC just reaches his arm around me and pulls me close.*

MC: “So I’ll take that silence as a yes then?”

N: “...fine.”

*We then hear from upstairs what sounds like a loud cheer and both quickly turn around. It’s his mom and dad both smiling ear to ear at both of us.*

MCD: “That’s my boy! Just like his old man. A real ladies’ man.”

MCM: “I’m so happy for both of you.”

*I just bury my face into MC’s shoulder. Has anyone ever died of embarrassment before? I feel like I might be the first.*

MCD: “Oh honey. Let’s let the two lovebirds be. Congratulations you two!”

*They both quickly dart back to their room and out of sight. I look over at MC who has gone back to looking at his anime. Did all of that just really happen. Just...WHAT!? When did my life become some weird anime?! My mind is reeling from all of this. It’s not like I’m happy about all of this. At least that’s what I tell myself but I can’t help but smile. Dammit. Why can’t I stop smiling!?*

*I then feel MC place his head on mine.*

MC: “Wanna know something Natsuki?”

N: “What?”

MC: “I’m happy”

*I feel him squeeze my hand as he says that. I sigh and continue to rest my head on his shoulder.*

N: “MC?”

MC: “Yes?”

N: “...I’m happy too”",0

I played with Citrix and Xen back in the day. I also have a couple KVM VM's on two Ubuntu dekstops. 


Currently I have five Dell R5500 machines in a HA cluster with a single 4U storage appliance as my homelab. Is there anything out there I should consider? Is it worth it to pay VMware for an ESXi license? 


Thanks. 


edit: EVERYTHING I own is licensed and paid for. I might spin up a VM here or there that I destroy in a day or three --but EVERYTHING I own has a licence and is paid for. I'd like to keep it that way. I'm sure I can probably torrent and crack a Windows Server OS license or maybe even find a VMware crack solution --I'm not interested in that.

7tlyro,1517163779,mcd,"Death or orphan records from Knoxville, TN around 1880? Other advice appreciated.","For over a decade, I've been trying to break through a brick wall regarding the birth parents of my great-grandfather McDuffie Weams. Long story short, he was born in 1876 and grew up in the town of Central in Pickens County, South Carolina. He was raised along with his brother Noah by the Weams family, but their real parents have always been a mystery.

McDuffie's brother Noah died in 1905 (in his 20's), and the obituary says this:

""Noah and McD. Weams were orphan children and were reared at Central by a kind-hearted gentleman who gave them a home.""

""Weams, who is a teacher of vocal music, said last night that his brother came to Greenville last July from Central, where they had both been raised by friends who had adopted them. The family is originally from Central, but lived for a while in Knoxville, where the mother was buried about twenty years ago. From early boyhood, the dead man and McD. Weams have been orphans.""

So this makes it sound like McDuffie's birth mother was originally from Central, moved to Knoxville where she died, and her two boys (McDuffie and Noah) were then adopted by the Weams family in Central. The 1905 obituary says she died about twenty years ago, which would be around 1885.

There are two young boys named Willie and Henry living in the Weams household in Central in the 1880 Census. This is the only time they appear, so it's very possible they were McDuffie and Noah going by different names. In the 1900 census, they are listed as McDuffie and Noah, but their ages line up with Willie and Henry. Therefore, it's possible their birth mother died in the late 1870s or even 1880 before the census was taken.

Would there be any records of this? The Weams family obviously knew who the birth mother was, and it sounds like she had roots in Central. Unfortunately, I have no names to go on. My only hope would be to look for a woman who died in Knoxville who was originally from South Carolina and left behind two young boys, but that seems like a long shot. Any advice would be appreciated.

7tm5pc,1517165448,tsla,Multiplying .head() of DataFrame(?) makes all the rest of numbers disappear,"Hi, the title may be a bit misleading, since I don't really know what's going on. 

I want to see the percentage change of the stock Tesla. The formula itself is not wrong, but I believe the execution in Python is. 

Explanation: 

Stage 1, tesla_s2) 
Firstly I divide 100/(the first number from all of the stock dates I have) by using .head(1) on the dataframe. I use the number 100 since I want the percentage change to start at 100. This calculation is the same as 10/222.87=0.44xxx, done manually. In the code, you can see that the stock price 222.87 is replaced with .head(1) because I want this number to be placed in automatically, which by itself works. I have printed it, it returns the correct value. 

Stage 2, tesla_s3) Then I multiply this weight I just got with all of the different prices of the stock. However, this returns NaN on all prices in the DataFrame except the first one, which coincidentally is tesla_s1.head(1) Here is my code: 
    
    #Here I get data from Yahoo Finance about Tesla
    tesla_s1 = web.DataReader(""TSLA"", ""yahoo"", start, end)
    #Here I read the information I have gotten from a local 
    #.cvs file with all the stock information
    tesla_s1 = pd.read_csv('tsla_s1.csv', parse_dates=True, 
    index_col=0)
    #Here I find the weight of the first number in the stock 
    data. I have tried to print this part, it works.
    tesla_s2 = 100/tesla_s1.head(1)
    #The problem comes when I try to multiplicate this 
    #weight, tesla_s2 with all the numbers in the dataframe:
    tesla_final = (tesla_s1*tesla_s2)
    #tesla_final printed returns the correct number in the 
    .head(1), but also returns NaN in all of the other 
     numbers. This is the problem.

I hope this was well explained, it is quite complex. I think maybe the computer thinks that it only is allowed to use the first number, tesla_s1.head(1), in later calculations. I don't know though.

I really appreciate all help on this problem.",1

7tmlia,1517169130,mcd,Pregame Sunday Brunch Talk: Building a 2018-2019 playoff team,"News suggest that McD is going to be aggressive this offseason and maybe even before the trade deadline to compete for next year. I agree with the idea of going all in but I just don't know which superstar talent Suns can acquire via trade or Free Agency to really go all in. That said, I think if Suns can add a few veterans and draft the right players, Suns could build a team that can compete for a playoff spot next year without compromising developing a team that could compete for a title. 

Position of needs: 1 and 5
Real Needs: Defense, Shooting and improve AST/TO ratio

Free Agent: Sign physical veterans that has playoff and championship experience for 1-2 years for less than $8M annually

Zaza Pachulia- 6th best in DPRM for Cs 
Mario Chalmers - 18th best in DPRM for PGs

(Both are not the most likable guys in the league- I know but it might be exactly what the Suns need) 

Draft: 
Michael Porter- not popular here but I think even with the injury he is the player that has the most potential to be any teams #1 player. He will be what KD is to Curry for Book. 
Second option: Mikal Bridges 

Center- Mitchell Robinson
Projected to be available between 16-25. If, focus at Center is mainly for defensive and rebounding purpose, this should be the area where you get most value than using the #1 pick for Bamba or Ayton. 
Second option: Brandon McCoy 

PG - Shake Milton. Projected to be available between 26 to 35. Somewhat can be considered a veteran PG because of age. Long and has potential to be elite defensively. 
Second options: Bruce Brown/Kyri Thomas

2018 starting 5: 
Zaza-Porter-Booker-Chalmers 
JJ/TJ/Bender/Chriss to battle of the other starting position 

1- Chalmers/Ulis/Milton 
2- Booker/Reed/Knight
3- JJ/Warren/Dudley
4- Porter/Chriss/Williams
5- Zaza/Tyson/Robinson/Bender

In the one day I started trading on Robinhood I made ~$31 (~3%). I invested heavily in NVDA and STX, a little MU, and I’m thinking of getting TSLA, INTC, and even more STX and NVDA. Is investing in tech a bad idea as a long term or short term hold? I read there was a dotcom bubble that popped in 2000, so I’m wondering if more experienced traders here can pass down some knowledge / insight / foresight into the potential consequences of my decisions.

Edit: TSLA is unreasonable. Got it, thank you.

7tr1fj,1517215869,aapl,I was down -22% this few months ago. My current progress now + holdings + a quick question.,"So around December of 2017, I was making a dumb choice by going in on penny stocks without knowing anything about it. Lost a few thousands since. In addition to penny stocks (2) I was heavy into Chinese stocks (not anything like $BABA) but the ones like $QD, $BZUN, etc. Also lost tons of money from them. I tried averaging down every time, but the stock didn't go up, except for BZUN with the recent recovery.

Anyways, this is me on Dec. 5th of 2017: https://i.imgur.com/lBxcaRj.png

And this is me today: https://i.imgur.com/L1jdZih.png

**QUESTION**
So as you can see, I was down nearly 22% and according to the ""[The Math of Gains and Losses - Steven M Berman](http://bermanadvisors.com/files/smb-161205-The_Math_of_Investment_Gains__Losses.pdf)"", I would need about 28% of gains to break even right? This is something that really surprises me when someone shared the link after I told him I lost that much.

The holdings (include sold and current) that has helped me on my way to breaking even: 

* PYPL
* SQ
* JNJ
* WYNN
* AAPL
* BABA
* FB
* PETS
* MU
* TEAM

**P.S**: Still holding $BSTI and down almost $600 lol. Alibaba has some stake in it so I'm hoping for a good ER soon.

Would love to hear any feedbacks or similar stories.",0

Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz says he was too optimistic on unit growth but too pessimistic on ASP. The analyst notes that it appears the ""super cycle"" he wanted is not here, and $54B in free cash flow in 2018 will have to do instead. Longer term, Uerkwitz remains steadfast in his belief that without the addition of new, meaningfully large product categories, Apple will enter an extended period of slow growth as the secular smartphone growth era comes to end and shifts to AI driven devices.

Now where I live I tend to get these mail advertisements from local and global companies(BK, MCD, jimbobs cleaning etc) by the boatload. What I began noticing is people just throw these away garbage can next to the mail box full of them. I wonder if there is someway to capitalize off this waste and provide companies value by making these coupons electronic(maybe a weekly QR code with all the coupon listings, perhaps making them targeted). It might require alot of data but i think something like this would be feasible. You guys see this idea having any weight?",0

On one hand, it would absolutely suck to take on that money, since it would tie us up for two years - a time when McD has expressed “aggressive” pursuits in free agency to accelerate the timeline. I doubt the Suns even inquire.
 
On the other hand, this could be an opportunity to insure us against bad-luck lottery positioning. If we could get a young prospect (Ntilikina) or a first-round pick, we have better odds at addressing our positional needs with young potential. The thing is, would the Knicks ever attach these assets to Joakim’s behemoth contract? In my eyes, that’s the only way they could trade him off.
 
What would it take for you (or Suns management) to be comfortable absorbing Noah’s salary? Is it just such a bad contract that we don’t touch it with a ten foot pole?",0

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Bill Gates has long been a huge fan of Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker and his book, &amp;quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.&amp;quot; In fact, last year the Microsoft MSFT, -0.29% founder hailed it as the most inspiring book he has ever read, and he urged college grads to read it.

&gt; Well, Pinker apparently has managed to top himself with his new book, &amp;quot;Enlightenment Now,&amp;quot; which is &amp;quot;Like &amp;#039;Better Angels&amp;#039; on steroids,&amp;quot; according to Gates.

&gt; &amp;quot;I read the book slowly since I loved it so much, but I think most people will find it a quick and accessible read,&amp;quot; says Gates.

&gt; &amp;quot;The result is a holistic picture of how and why the world is getting better,&amp;quot; Gates explains in a blog post.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s because we have better weather prediction capabilities, improved safety education, and more people living in cities.

&gt; That time represents nearly half a day every week that could be used for everything from binge-watching Ozark or reading a book to starting a new business.

7twd80,1517266656,msft,[Microsoft] ADFS: Monitoring a Relying Party for Certificate Changes,"Hi Everybody!  And now, for an article that I know nothing about :-)

I can't even really summarize it, so just read it.  Its got lots of pictures and PowerShell and...stuff.

&gt; #ADFS: Monitoring a Relying Party for Certificate Changes

&gt; Howdy folks!

&gt; [Michele Ferrari](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Profile/Michele%20Ferrari%20%5BMSFT%5D) here from the Premier Field Engineer-Identity Team in San Francisco, here today to talk about ADFS Monitoring settings for Claims Provider Trust and Relying Party Trust.

&gt; This is the question we’re going to answer today as part of the **Mix and Match series**:

&gt; **How can we Monitor when our partners’ Identity Providers update the Signing and Encryption certificates?**

&gt; Well, what I’m implementing it’s something which is still not available today but, our PG is aware, and it will be included in vNext. Before going straight to the solution, I want to present a real scenario and recall some of the basic concepts in the Identity space.

&gt; The solution we discuss can be used to monitor either the Claims Provider Trust or the Relying Party Trust certificates =&gt; same knowledge can be applied to that as-well.

&gt; **Relying Party** signature certificate is rarely used indeed. It is meant when the SaaS application provider also wants to digitally sign the SAML Sign-In request, when the request is sent over to the ADFS server to ensure the SAML request doesn’t get modified somehow. There isn’t typically anything important in the SAML request but there are cases where the application owner or us want to enforce a certain authentication type. Signing the SAML request ensures no one modifies the request.

&gt; It’s also possible to encrypt the SAML request but this is definitely rare to see in the real life.

&gt; If you want to understand more what a SAML Protocol Sign-In request looks like, read this post from [Dave Gregory](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/dgreg+-+MSFT) here=&gt;https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2014/11/02/adfs-deep-dive-comparing-ws-fed-saml-and-oauth/

&gt; Ready? Follow me…

*[Redditor note - You really should be ready]*

&gt; **Let’s start from a practical example:**

&gt; CONTOSO.COM wants to allow his employees to access a 3rd party application called ClaimsWeb hosted by MISTERMIK.COM , providing the SingleSignOn experience.

&gt; --&gt; John, an employee at CONTOSO.COM wants to access an expense note application (ClaimsWeb).

&gt; **Let’s break this down and identify all the moving parts involved:**

&gt; [Picture 1](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/01/012918_2010_ADFSMonitor1.png)

&gt; * **John**, is an User member of CONTOSO.COM. It’s called **Subject**.

&gt; * **CONTOSO.COM** is the ***Identity Provider*** (abbreviated IP in WS-Federation, IdP in SAML) authenticates a client using, for example, Windows integrated authentication. It creates a SAML token based on the claims provided by the client and might add its own claims. A Relying Party application (RP) receives the SAML token and uses the claims inside to decide whether to grant the client access to the requested resource.

&gt; * **MISTERMIK.COM** is a software vendor **offering SaaS solutions** in the cloud.
MISTERMIK.COM decides that its ClaimsWeb application should trust CONTOSO.COM because of CONTOSO.COM purchasing a license for the ClaimsWeb application. MISTERMIK.COM here plays the role of the **Relying Party STS**,
--&gt; which does not authenticate the client, but relies on a SAML token provided by an IP-STS that It trusts (CONTOSO).

&gt; **CLAIMSWEB.mistermik.com** is the ***Relying Party Application***. Synonyms for an RP include “claims aware application” and “claims-based application”.  

&gt; &gt; * A relying party is a Federation Service or application that consumes claims to make authorization decisions: an application that trusts an Identity Provider is referred to as a relying party or RP.

&gt; &gt; Claims provider trust:

&gt; &gt; * It is a trust object that is created to maintain the relationship with another Federation Service that provides claims to this Federation Service.

&gt; MISTERMIK’S ADFS has a claims provider trust with CONTOSO’S AD FS = CONTOSO’S ADFS provides CONTOSO\\John’s claims to MISTERMIK’S AD FS.

&gt; **Relying party trust:**

&gt;&gt; It is a trust object that is created to maintain the relationship with a Federation Service or application that consumes claims from this Federation Service.

&gt;&gt; CONTOSO’AD FS has MISTERMIK.COM’s AD FS as Relying Party Trust. MISTERMIK.COM consumes claims coming from CONTOSO’S AD FS.

&gt; Now that we have covered the terminology with the entities that will play the role of the IdP or IP, and RP, we want to make it perfectly clear in our mind and go through the flow one more time.

&gt; Let’s write something on the whiteboard and focus on steps:

&gt; [Picture 2](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/01/012918_2010_ADFSMonitor3.png)

&gt; ***Step : Present Credentials to the Identity Provider***

&gt; **1.1.** When John from CONTOSO.COM attempts to use ClaimsWeb App for the first time (that is, when he first navigates to https://clamisweb.mistermik.com ), there’s no session established yet. In other words, from an identity’s point of view, the User is unauthenticated. The URL provides the application with a hint about the customer that is requesting access

&gt; **1.2.** The application redirects John’s browser to the Identity’s issuer (the federation provider/AD FS). That is because MISTERMIK.COM’S federation provider is the application’s trusted issuer. As part of the redirection URL, the application includes the whr parameter that provides a hint to the federation provider about the customer’s home realm. The value of the whr parameter is http://contoso/trust.

&gt; **1.3.** The MISTERMIK.COM ‘s federation provider uses the whr parameter to look up the customer’s Identity Provider and redirect John’s browser back to CONTOSO issuer.

&gt; Assuming that John uses a computer that is already a part of the domain and in the corporate network, he will already have valid network credentials that can be presented to CONTOSO.COM’s Identity provider.

At this point, I really *really* recommend that you go to read at the article link.  This article does not format well on reddit.

Hopefully this helps satisfy some of the more in depth posts that you are looking for.  We're coming out of the Holidays and it takes a few weeks to get back in to the swing of things.  As always, please leave any comments/questions/concerns here or at the article post.

If there is anything you want to see a deep dive on, let me know and we'll see what we can do.

7txfzc,1517276285,nflx,my learning from last ~25 years,"I am late 40's near FIRE. looking to RE soon and wanted to look at my experience
Wanted to share my experience/learning from last 25 years in both saving money, investing, and earning... 

**Investing**

* Focus on indexing and asset allocation. do not spend too much time thinking about timing the market or if it's too expensive or too cheap. it is only obvious after the fact.

* Timing. i have lived through 3 bubbles [1994 right after college, 2000 dot.com bubble, and 2009] I have lived through them fully vested in equity/bond mix that I have set.  I didn't have much money in 1994 and 2000, so it wasn't hard then. now seeing your NW go down by 40% in 2008 was painful. the key thing's that helped me are 1&gt; enough cash buffer for 6 months, in case I get laid off 2&gt; set asset allocation and stick to them 3&gt; do not day trade

**Saving**

* I lived really cheap in my 20s and 30s.  no Cable TV, just NFLX DVD for $10/M, used car 'till I was 35 + library for most of my music/book/entertainment. 

* bought most of my furniture/household goods via Craigslist

* your savings in 20s and early 30s are really critical. Once you hit ~$100K NW, they do get easier

**earning**

* It is good to save, but you do need some good earnings to get there. I was lucky in my career, but if you are starting out I would suggest an engineering degree to offer one of the best ROI

I'm a senior software engineer at one of the big tech companies (GOOG/FB/AAPL) in a high cost of living area. My salary and perks are quite good. Despite the high cost of living, I've been able to save quite a bit by living below my means. However, my wife and I are considering moving back to the Twin Cities to be closer to family.

7tz9d2,1517295684,tsla,If you're freaking out about ETHOS's timeline...read this,"I'm an investor in Ethos, an entrepreneur, and marketing exec who has a knack for product development. I'm not a self-proclaimed crypto expert, but I've been seeing people freak out in Reddit and on Telegram about ETHOS's timeline for UW and Fiat gateway release. Stephen and Shingo have done well to field these questions and show why they're not concerned, but I wanted to share a different perspective from someone who is not on the ETHOS team. 

Yes- there are a lot of companies now moving into the space of creating both Universal Wallets, and also (the holy mountain) Fiat Gateways to purchase, sell, and spend crypto. Some of the likes include: Coinbase, Robinhood, Gemini, Curve, and half a dozen more. If ETHOS is successful in executing it's vision, I'm confident that it would destroy all of it's competition and the ones that I haven't mentioned. 

The fear that's been expressed over competition, and that you need to be the first mover in order to be successful...This is simply a false assumption. Let's look at the big tech companies.

Facebook - remember Myspace? Friendster? Bolt? 
Facebook wasn't the first mover, there were over a 100 social media startups that were started before the first version of Facebook came into existence. They didn't have first mover advantage, but what they did offer was a better user experience, and a way to connect with people who you're close with. (I'll speak more to Facebook's rollout later).

Google - remember Yahoo? Lycos? AltaVista? AskJeeves? 
Google wasn't the first company to create a search engine, they simply had a better algorithm for their search that beat everyone else. If they would have launched 6 months later, they would have still beaten Yahoo and all the rest, because their solution was radically different and a 100X improvement above the rest.

Was Amazon the first company to sell products online? 
Tesla the first company to build a car? (TSLA has a larger market cap than Ford Motors right now, and they're not even a profitable company)

Being a first mover can have it's advantages, but it's not the end all. The companies that dominate the industry (Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, etc), they don't just focus on solving customer's problems- they change the way that you interact with the world. 

These four companies that I've mentioned here - Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. If you're reading this, and you didn't just wake up from a coma, you can talk at length for 5-15 minutes (or more) about how each one of these companies has changed the way that you interact with technology, your environment, people who you know and don't know, and the world. 

None of these companies who are incorporating a fiat gateway to buy crypto is offering much that's drastically different from what the next one is offering. Where in ETHOS- the fiat gateway is not the end all solution, it's merely an important feature.

Let's look at a few features that ETHOS is offering, and what they could do for the crypto space from the perspective of the user:

Universal Wallet - In my opinion, there isn't a universal wallet that has the variety of coins needed, security, ease of access, and intuitive design that's needed for me to go with one solution. So, I'm stuck using a mix of a Hardware wallet, several desktop wallets, and custodial services. This is highly inefficient, wastes a lot of time, and creates a high barrier to entry for someone to get into crypto. Having a universal wallet that has all of the features that I've mentioned would not only make life a lot easier for me and every person who invests in crypto. It would also allow more people who are less tech savvy to enter into the market. The universal wallet is something that I believe people are underestimating the need for. If done right, this is just as important as a fiat gateway for the crypto space to grow. 

Fiat Gateway - Right now BTC and ETH (with a few others), have a stranglehold on the industry because it's really one of the few things that you can trade with. So, I have to purchase BTC through Coinbase, send it over to an exchange (a process that can take many hours and costs the same amount as doing a wire transfer), trade it for that altcoin (more fees), and then send it over to a more secure wallet (even more fees). In this process, I had to use 3 different apps that aren't all very easy to use, it took a considerable amount of time, and cost way more than it should have. With ETHOS, there going to have a way to purchase from around 100 (someone likely knows the exact answer to this) altcoins directly, and the place where it lands is a secure wallet. 1 App, very little time, and minimal fees. 

1 Click Diversification - If I have a bunch of BTC and want to diversify it into a dozen coins. I have to go into an exchange and day trade. This process sometimes takes minutes, and sometimes you make a bid and wake up the next morning to see that the coin you wanted to buy increased by 25% while you were sleeping and your bid didn't fully execute. This 1-Click Diversification allows you to diversify your portfolio in minutes (maybe seconds) without having to deal with the process of getting the right price down to a micro-penny. There's always the opportunity to use an exchange if you want to day trade, but you won't be forced to. 

There's a dozen other features that I could break down including the ability to invest in traditional assets (stocks, bonds), debit card issuance, social media platform, etc. Looking at the features alone does not show the big picture. 

For those of you who haven't read the whitepaper, read their Medium posts, dug through Telegram, etc- I recommend you do more research as the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. 

Ethos is working to fundamentally change the way that we interact with our personal finances and engage with the financial world. 

Here are some examples of what the ETHOS platform could replace if they are able to execute and gain mass adoption: 

Crypto Purchasing Services  - ETHOS could replace Gemini, Coinbase, etc

Many Crypto Wallets              - ETHOS could replace desktop, and hardware wallet solutions

Crypto Exchanges                 -  ETHOS could replace Binance, Bittrex, etc

Coin Profiles &amp; Data               - ETHOS could replace CoinMarketCap

Social Media for crypto/finance - ETHOS could replace Reddit, YouTube, Steemit, etc

Stock Market Trading Apps   - ETHOS could replace Robinhood, E-Trader, etc

Debit Card connected to crypto - ETHOS could replace TenX, Shift Card, etc

Checking account                  - ETHOS could replace YOUR BANK! (Chase, Wells Fargo, etc)

Taxes                                      - ETHOS could provide a crypto tax specialist, CPA, accountant

Additional Financial Services - ETHOS could connect you to a variety of providers/vendors of different financial services

This list goes on a lot further, but I hope that you're starting to see that the way that the ETHOS team is building this product is fundamentally different. They're not going to be a commodity like the others competing to offer 'the better fiat gateway', they have the potential to change the way that we interact with our personal finances and the greater financial world. They're likely going to turn CoinBase into the 'AskJeeves' of crypto investment. (Remember when we used to only be able to buy 3 coins off of CoinBase and you couldn't even diversify?)

Not every single person who uses the app will use all of the ETHOS functionality as a one-stop shop, but they could, and many people will.

Just like some people purchase 1/2 of what they own off of Amazon.

Just like some people use Google Search, GMaps, YouTube, and other Google Products to answer any question they have.

Just like some people own an iPhone, iPad, IMac, iWatch and use it for most of their tech needs. 

I'm excited to be an early investor in Ethos, and I'm on the same boat as Shingo and Stephen. I'm not concerned in the least with their timeline. 

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts in the comments below. If this is helpful let me know as I can post a bit more from the perspective of an entrepreneur who's working to disrupt a different industry. 

For those who are going to the April meetup in Rhode Island- announce yourself, and we can meet in person. 

[Added after post went live] Based on the response from this post, I’m considering writing a few more posts that break down Ethos in depth and want your feedback. Upvote a reply that I added that has a few suggestions for new posts, and add your comment so I know what you are interested in.

**The draft will be done via first-pick.com. If you're thinking about saying ""B-but that draft isn't realistic!"" please [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Colts/comments/682dho/remember_what_i_said_about_that_draft_will_never/?st=jd1of62v&amp;sh=2be6ebb4).**

**The presumption is made that we are moving to a 4-3 Defence.**

So, just to set out our stall, we begin this off-season with seven draft picks, one in each round, and $77.3m in cap space before re-signing any of our own free agents. On that note.

**FREE AGENCY**  
As I mentioned, we have a number of our own guys to re-sign. Here are those I re-signed and their average yearly salary...

- Adam Vinatieri, K - $3m  
- Barkevious Mingo, OLB - $2.5m  
- Pierre Desir, CB - $1.75m  
- Jon Bostic, MLB - $1.5m  
- Michael Person, C - $1m    
- Edwin Jackson, WLB - $750k  

Reasoning: Some might frown at some of the decisions I've made here. First off, I let Melvin walk. Spotrac's statistical comparison had him compared with Janoris Jenkins and AJ Bouye. Melvin has the potential to earn big bucks in the NFL this year. However, one really good year isn't enough for me to splurge on a soon-to-be 29 year old CB. Letting Moncrief walk was a hard decision, but he was being compared to guys earning $6m a year, something I felt would be better used elsewhere. Mewhort retired. We bought him a cake (did not affect cap).

I re-signed a lot of LB corps just because we'll need depth, we're transitioning, and I wouldn't be comfortable replacing almost every non-starter when we can bring some guys back on the cheap. Better the devil you know...

Signings:  

- Albert Wilson, WR, Chiefs - $3.75m  
- Josh Kline, OG, Titans - $10m  
- Zach Fulton, OG/C, Chiefs - $2m  
- Alex Okafor, DE, Saints - $9m  
- Tahir Whitehead, WLB, Lions - $8.5m  
- Zach Brown, MLB, Redskins - $3m   
- Michael Thomas, S, Dolphins - $2m

Reasoning: First off, I didn't want to age the team too much. We've a new head coach, I want these guys to be successful here for 5+ years. We managed to bag some big names. Some might be disappointed I went for Kline. However, he spent three and half years under McDaniels, so his familiarity, and his slightly lower price gave him the edge. He's a great guard. Tahir Whitehead is a guy I really wanted, and is a day one starter at WLB. If we're changing scheme, I want to make it a success. Hence the signing of Okafor, a standout this year that the relatively cap-poor Saints couldn't afford to bring back. The thought of him on one side, with Sheard on the other had me salivating. Brown is somebody I've wanted for years and provides an upgrade at a bargain price. Finally, I adorned Chris Ballard's face skin as a mask, and took a visit to Kansas. There I picked up Wilson, a shifty first-down machine who can be deadly from the slot under JMcD, and Fulton, a great backup for when one of our lineman inevitably go down. Finally, Michael Thomas is good depth at safety, and a tremendous special teamer too.

**TRADE**  
Well, here's something I've never done in one of these before...

Colts Receive|Falcons Receive|
:--|:--|
Tevin Coleman, RB|Round 4, Pick 4 (106th overall inc. comp picks)|

Reasoning: We need an RB. With Bell, in this situation, franchise tagged by the Steelers, I wasn't really enamoured with any of the better remaining prospects at the price they wanted. With just a year left on his rookie contract, and happy to roll with Devonta Freeman going forwards, the Falcons were open to a win-win deal. They get something for a guy they would've likely lost for nothing in a year, we get a starting quality, 24 year old RB for a cheap cap hit in 2018, and a whole year to negotiate a longer deal going forward. Seeing as it frees us up immensely in the draft, I felt comfortable giving up a fourth.

Let's go ahead and remove the cap space we need to sign this year's rookie class, which leaves us with...

**Cap Space Remaining: $22.9m**

**DRAFT**  
Round 1, Pick 7 (TB): Minkah Fitzpatrick, CB, Alabama  
Round 2, Pick 4: Will Hernandez, OG, Texas-El Paso  
Round 3, Pick 3: Lorenzo Carter, OLB, Georgia     
Round 3, Pick 10 (SF): Simmie Cobbs Jr, WR, Indiana  
Round 4, Pick 21 (BUF): Jake Wieneke, WR, South Dakota State  
Round 5, Pick 3: Tegray Scales, ILB, Indiana  
Round 6, Pick 4: Poona Ford, DT, Texas  
Round 7, Pick 3: Heath Harding, CB, Miami (OH)

UDFA:  
- Lane Clark, K, Tennessee State  
- Rashard Fant, CB, Indiana  
- Drew Bailey, DT, Louisville  
- Ralph Webb, RB, Vanderbilt  
- Marcus Martin, FB, Slippery Rock  
- Nick DeLuca, LB, North Dakota State  

Overview: QBs went 1 and 2. I took a shot at trading with the Buccs, for their first and third, and moving down four spots. I had Chubb and Fitzpatrick still available. I ran from the war room and pinned Goodell down, shouting ""FITZPATRICK!"" over and over again. Through a bit more jiggery-pokery, I managed to a second high-third pick, and get back our fourth we'd lost for Coleman.

After filling out a lot of holes prior to the draft, I felt relaxed about taking not just one WR, but two! Cobbs is our Moncrief replacement, and Jake Weineke is the big bodied guy who is gonna take the NFL by storm in his rookie year (watch this space!). Hernandez likely starts day one. Scales is a do-it-all guy who should be competing for a lot of snaps even in his rookie year. Ford too. Harding is an aggressive corner who can spot a starter when needed.

I moved quickly to bring in some free agents at the conclusion too. Marcus Martin is an intriguing prospect. The all-time leading NCAA sack record holder is expected to enter the pros as a FB. Josh McD might be able to find something for him to do. Nick DeLuca is a sneaky shot not only to make the roster, but maybe even contribute more than you'd think, especially on obvious running downs.

**FINAL DEPTH CHART**  
[Click here](https://i.imgur.com/M2o0PwQ.png) to take a look at the final depth chart after projected cuts to get down to 53 men.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**  
I think this sets us up nicely. Obviously not every one of our draft picks will pan out, but I think all the holes are a little more plugged than before. We're worryingly thin at corner. That's my big concern here. If Wilson isn't what we think he is, Fitzpatrick needs to really hit the ground running. If he doesn't, then we're boned. If there's an injury to either of those two guys, we're boned. However, there is a really nice contingent of corners hitting free agency in 2019, and we'll still have around $30m in cap space...

The D looks miles better already. It wasn't cheap, but that front seven looks mighty fine now, especially at LB, where we've now got enough pieces that we can allow for guys to struggle in the transition. 

The much maligned o-line isn't perfect, but it's getting there. If Hernandez is a success, then we're set at four of the five starting spots, and that's better than most. 

WR will be intriguing. We know what TY can do, but I see a lot of rotation after him. Weineke and Cobbs are both big bodied guys, who really should take some pressure off Doyle in the red zone.

**So, there it is. My blueprint for... well, maybe not success, but hopefully better than 8-8? I think this team, with Luck's health being the obvious factor, is capable of at least making the playoffs. It's set up a little better to cope with injury to a starter or two, and has, if not made us stronger where we were already strong, made us stronger where we were previously weak, and to me, they're the most valuable changes of all.

7u1ul5,1517326886,msft,MSFT Take note: The thing that got me to finally use Edge was adding back the ability to pin a site with logo to the task bar.,"As simple as this sounds, I could access 95% of the Internet I used regularly with 1-2 clicks using pinned sites on the taskbar. Pinning with IE then changing default to Edge would erase the icons.

Why does this matter: Every product that MSFT rebuilds involves then dumping load of features that users depend on. They then proceed to be tone deaf with feedback. Then act shocked when their product fails. Again. Taskbar pinning is not the most important thing about a web browser. For me to use Edge as it was released would've required a substantial disruption in the way I use the internet. UX is the most important thing MSFT doesn't get right now. Period.",1
7u1who,1517327346,mcd,"SputnikGT's Shock Analysis: Stage One, Week Three","Hi everyone! I'm part of the r/competitiveoverwatch voter project.  We rate and analyze the teams as they play.  As the Shock rep, I write long versions of my analysis, so here it is!  You can read what everyone else has to say here https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/7u1nrh/rcompetitiveoverwatchs_official_owl_power/

Remember last week how I said that I didn’t have all that much confidence going into this week?

Yeah.

This was not a good week for the Shock. Sure, the Spitfire are a challenging opponent, but I expected the Shock to put up a decent fight, especially after beating Boston. That didn’t happen. The Shock lost 3-1, only taking Oasis. The Spitfire really struggle on Oasis, so that actually isn’t all that impressive.

Eichenwalde was the first map, and the Shock stumbled right out of the gate, getting full held. In what was a scrappy and disorganized attack, the Shock failed to get two ticks on the first point. There isn’t a whole lot to say about this attack. It was just...meh. That’s the only word I have for it. The defense was also extremely scrappy, although the Spitfire’s attack wasn’t great either. Sleepy was fragging out, and I thought the Shock had a chance. Then Fury came away with a two man D.Va bomb, and that was curtains for the Shock on Eichenwalde.

Shock got full held on Horizon again. The end.

Oasis! Here is where the Shock got a little bit better! This is the only map the Shock actually won this week, and they looked pretty good. Oasis is a good map for the Shock. University didn’t go so well for the Orange and Red, but Gardens and City Center were both quite convincing wins. The Shock played well here, but some of these good looks can definitely be chalked up to Oasis being the Spitfire’s worst map.

We then got to Junkertown. Here, the Spitfire recovered from their stall and put up a good show. Firing up their Rolls-Royce Merlin V12s, the Spitfire roared into a great defense, Superchargers whining as they delivered 1,500 bhp of quality shutdown “D”. The Shock were unable to get the Spitfire into a negative-G maneuver, which would have caused the fuel to slosh the wrong direction in the carburetor. This would have caused the Spitfire’s engines to cut out. Eventually, the Shock got through first, but it was a slow slog through second, especially considering the Shock somehow forgot to push the cart for about 45 seconds. The Shock only made it about 3/4s of the way through second before getting halted. The Spitfire then rolled on through the middling Shock defense.

To be quite frank, I spent a lot of time just blankly staring at my screen, trying to figure out what to write about this game. It was just so...meh. That’s the only word I can think of for it. Meh. Aside from Sleepy, who fragged out, no one did really well, and no one had a really bad game either. Everything was just kinda below average. The positioning was below average. The decision making was below average. The mechanical skill was below average. It was all just kind of below average. Aside from a few big plays from both Zens, nothing really stood out this game for me.

The Fuel game was an entirely different story. The Dallas Fuel came into this game running on fumes. They have the makings of a super team, but it just isn’t clicking right now. It’s like someone has bought a Ferrari but is now trying to fill it up with diesel. Harryhook was sick, Taimou is in a big slump, xQc is suspended, and the entire team is underperforming at a level no one expected. To make matters worse, the team is poorly equipped to run dive. Mickie’s D.Va isn’t what it once was, Cocco’s Winston is iffy at best and nowhere near as good as xQc’s, and Seagull’s Genji hasn’t been brilliant in the few times we have seen it in the OWL. So Dallas ran an anti-dive Orisa/Hog comp for almost the entire game. This comp doesn’t have a fancy name like “dive” or “deathball” or “phalanx”, which is sad. So I’m going to give it one.

I hereby designate the Orisa/Hog anti-dive comp as the “Wounded Moose” composition. Let it be called that now and forever.

The reason I’ve called it this is because it is dangerous if you get too close to it, and punishes positioning mistakes hard. A wounded moose is less dangerous if you stay far away, but still dangerous if you get close. Hence the name.

Also I just like to say “Wounded Moose”. It’s fun. Try it a few times.

Anyway, Dallas’ Wounded Moose worked to perfection against the Shock, mostly because the Shock’s dives were pretty bad this game. The real issue for the Shock was consistency. This was instantly clear on Eichenwalde, where the Shock rolled on through their first attack only to be full held on round two, taking a draw on a map that probably should have been won. Babybay was the most inconsistent of all, dominating on Pharah on the first attack and then becoming less accurate than the steering on a ‘99 Chevy Suburban on the second attack.

The Shock got full held on…

Wait.

They didn’t?

Well, damn, I’m gonna have to go and rewatch that. I just assumed that they were gonna get full held due to their prior track record and played some competitive during that map.

In a stunning turn of events, the Shock were not full held on Horizon Lunar Colony! I mean, they still lost, but at this point I’ll take what I can get on that map. Running with the Sombra offense, the Shock actually took both points with relative ease. The defense was less impressive, as the Shock ran a somewhat effective Wounded Moose comp that couldn’t withstand the Dallas attack. Unfortunately, for the second attack, it was back to business as usual for the Shock, with strange ult usages and dives. The Wounded Moose comp punishes bad positioning to an extent unrivaled by any other team comp, so the Shock got crushed, sending them down 1-0 in the series.

Going into Ilios, I was feeling pretty good. The Shock are pretty good at control, and I expected them to pull even in the series. Unfortunately, that wasn’t what happened at all. There were two problems with the Ilios round. Problem one was Mickie. Mickie’s Roadhog has never been what he’s known for, but he shined this map. The larger problem was the Shock’s decision making, which was baffling. Who in their right mind would run Dhak on Zenyatta and Sleepy on Mercy. Anyone? Well, that’s what the Shock did. Guess what? It didn’t work. Like….I don’t even know what the thought process was there.

Junkertown was just depressing, a fitting end to a cruddy week. Nothing worked, the Wounded Moose comp beat the Shock into oblivion, the defenses were bad from the Shock, the attacks were bad from the Shock. Again, aside from Sleepy, everything this game was pretty bad. Danteh was not getting kills. The tank play was kind of ok but not good. The Support play was iffy. Babybay was about as inconsistent as it gets. The differences between rounds for him was like the difference between a medium rare, excellently prepared steak, and a well done steak dunked in a cocktail of A.1 and Relish and then topped with a garnish of kibble. This game had me groaning the whole way through. It was painful to watch.

The Shock have some problems on their roster. That is apparent. Everyone is waiting on Sinatraa and Super before to make judgements on the Shock. However, many of these problems can be fixed by stage 2! The free agent signing period started with a bang, with Dallas signing aKm, and taking one of the most sought after names off of the market immediately. Personally, I think the Shock should pick up three free agents: Adam, FctFctn, and Mangachu.

This might come off as a little odd, but here me out. With Adam and Mangachu in the mix the Shock instantly have one of the best rosters for Control. Put Adam on Mercy and Mangachu on Pharah and you go from Babybay’s inconsistency to Mangachu’s precise and jaw dropping projectile play. You also have the option to put in iddqd for the McCree. Add all of that up and you get a team that is incredibly scary on any control map. FctFctn is just a good depth piece, as he is better than Nomy (although Nomy is improving from past weeks) and gives the Shock more flexibility. Supplement those three with Sinatraa and Super and the team looks real good going into the latter half of the season.

The Shock go on opposite ends of the spectrum next week, taking on the Outlaws first. The Outlaws are red hot right now, thanks in no small part to standout performances from Linkzr and Jake. They then play the McMayhem, who are in a McBig McSlump. McLogix has been playing a good McHitscan, particularly his McMcCree, and McManneten’s McD.Va has looked McOK. But McTviq has been McStruggling, and the rest of the roster is McMediocre at McBest. The only thing that they are McBest at is McMemeing, but we will see if they can McRecover. Hopefully the Shock have a much better week next week. I expect a lot more from this team, and I think they can get there. Just put this week behind and move on.",0

The Skype button on the People page of Outlook.com actually takes you to Skype.com, not starting a Skype session with any of the contacts. etc. This has been trash since Skype was brought in the fold.

7u4an6,1517346238,tsla,So I rented a Model 3 and a Model S to compare. My personal experience.,"I have a Day 1 Model 3 Reservation. 
I've been excited about it all along. I sat in one at my local Tesla center in Century City. Not satisfied with the 2 minutes I had, I decided to rent a Model 3 and took it for a nice long ride down PCH and Mulholland in Malibu. The next day I rented a Model S 75 to compare and did the same. Took my wife out to an early dinner each time.

I don't have any groundbreaking insights here, only personal experience, but here it goes:
I went to pick up the Model 3 in my BMW i3. Not going to lie, I had high expectations. I was instantly excited, but even in the white color I chose this one in, there was this ""uncanny valley"" quality to it where the shape just feels a tiny bit off for no real reason at all. Driving it was great - car felt tight, car felt quick, car felt sporty. Felt a little bit like my old E90 M3 did, but let's not get carried away here, a BMW M3 it is not.
The more I got used to it, the more I liked it, but everything I liked about the car was accompanied by something that equally annoyed me.
Door handles are stupid - but its ok, I'll get used to it.
How do you operate the _____? Oh, there it is...weird, but its ok, I'll get used to it.
I really wish it had an instrument panel - but its ok, I'll get used to it.
I can go over every little detail, but that's of no use here...you're in the Tesla motors subreddit, you've already read it a dozen times.

I found myself trying to convince myself that this wasn't just a futuristic Mazda 3, but the overwhelmingly lasting impression was that it was exactly that. My wife reserved an opinion until the end of the night - she described it like this: ""It's fun, and its pretty nice, but it feels like this will be the Toyota Corolla in 2025."" I agreed.

The next day I picked up the Model S 75 in our 2016 BMW X5. I walked up and immediately preferred the looks of it. The slight awkwardness of the Model 3 wasn't there. It felt like a sexy, sleek car and the premium materials made themselves instantly apparent. Everything felt ""right"". The speed was there, the ride quality was there, it was the perfect balance of sporty comfort that I expected.
There was no real learning curve, everything was intuitive, and I enjoyed the experience even though I had already test driven a Model S years ago and Model X when a friend purchased one. It was nice, but that was it: Nice. The touchscreen is beautiful, but you get over it. The ride quality is fantastic, but I've already grown to expect that from a luxury car. What else was there? Maybe I needed more time, but there was nothing that was a must-have for me, and I was sure looking for one.

So I've come to the previously unthinkable decision of simply holding off for now. 

If I want an EV with carpool sticker, the BMW i3 fills my needs. Are there differences? Of course! But personally, it's got enough space, enough range, and enough speed. The most unnerving thing about the Model 3 was how similar it felt to the i3 in real-world driving. Ride quality, acceleration and interior space 'felt' the same, regardless of what the spec sheet shows. 

If I want a luxury vehicle to ride in premium comfort, the BMW X5 fills my needs. Are there differences? Of course! But personally, it's got everything I want in terms of ride quality, features you expect from a $70k car, and the 'range' is upwards of 500miles with a 5min 'recharge' time. Ride quality and interior space 'felt' the same, while the premium materials in the X5 were actually a little better and visibility was better in the SUV as well. A 17"" touchscreen would be nice, but it wouldn't really make my driving experience any better.

So I'm personally deciding to hold off. The upside for me just wasn't there. I love Tesla as a brand, I've invested a relatively small amount in TSLA and I enjoy seeing their vision materialize  This wasn't a logistics or purely financial issue, although money is always a factory in some way - I have a 220V charger in my garage and in my dedicated parking spot at work, shared with only 2 other employee at my small company. I'm 30 years old, 2 toddlers at home. I'm not too old for a sporty suspension (I commuted in a track-suspension BMW M3 for years), and I'm not too young to dislike a comfortable ride (I had a Mercedes E-Class for a bit) - it's just a classic case of ""It's not you, it's me"". - What works best for my family and I is to keep what we have for the time being.

I share this not to validate whatever decision you've made, the level of excitement in this subreddit is already high and I'm not attempting to bring it down, just sharing a very subjective experience. 
I'm not sure what will change my mind in the future or what car I'll get next...maybe the Performance Model 3 will blow my socks off, who knows? Maybe I should've considered a P100D, who knows? Maybe I should've gotten that Carrera S that I fell in love with but decided against before Christmas, who knows? But for now, I'll sit on my Model 3 reservation to make a decision another day.

Being a part of this sub for a while I know the humour towards TSLA seems never-ending, however my aim here is to create a serious discussion about the company and its future (with an appropriate measure of humour). 

To start with my own DD, I'm short selling Tesla as of last week and my reasons behind it are as follows: 

1.) The company has consistently undershot earnings estimates for years now, and although revenues are rising they're not nearly rising fast enough to close the gap (gross profit has infact fallen quarter after quarter for the whole of this year thus far). Tesla also as of recently achieved a ROIC % of -18.32. Thus as a company it is actually unable to make any money with the money you invest into it, it's simply losing it and then turning to the next nearest investor. 

2.) Interest expense represented a whopping 200,000$ in 2016. To put that in comparison, Alibaba paid 388,000$ in interest for the 2016, yet is actually profitable and has a market cap of almost 10 times the size of Tesla. Moreover, to make things worse Tesla have now announced they will accumulate even more debt through issuing another round of bonds (https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tests-money-managers-demand-180753134.html). I almost also forgot to mention that US interest rates are being aggressively hiked this year (or at least forecasted to) thus for the long term debt Tesla holds (which is a huge proportion) it will see even bigger interest repayment bills. Finally, the more debt Tesla amasses the higher the premium it will have to pay to borrow (if it can find anyone left that will actually be willing to lend to them). 

3.) A more recent concern of mine which largely lead me to actually act on my bearish instinct with Tesla is the new pay package for Musk. In my eyes it's an 'All or nothing' experiment where he can gamble away government injected money in a hope to win big. If things begin to go south and market cap growth isn't reaching its target you can expect irrational short term behaviour to prop up the stock price at the expense of future returns. I.e. Its very likely long term debt will be accumulated to prop up the market cap at the expense of huge debt bills in the future and a rapidly deteriorating credit rating. 

4.) Teslas are a fairly niche market. They're not cheap and although they have a strong (some would say) cult following, they are soon going to be facing real competition from the likes of Daimler (parent of Mercedes) who have innovated aggressively since inception. Furthermore - with improving economic prospects for the Eurozone and the likes of German car manufacturers positioned well for the transition to electric cars, Tesla will be fighting a war on many fronts. More importantly this war will be fought against the same companies that have strong and deep customer loyalty rooted in the whole of Europe and well established trade routes with countries such as the UK and France. Their ability to trade freely across borders within the EU makes German Auto firms much more appealing to countries like Sweden and Norway where an electric car culture is becoming rapidly apparent. 

5.) Finally, Musk has missed every production target set thus far, by an extreme measure and to make matters worse key employees are packing up and moving elsewhere. Supply chain problems are also an issue and the actual ability to safely recycle lithium batteries remains at the forefront of environmental discussion. To make matters worse Trump is going to have to actually find a way to fund these policies he's pushing through to make 'everyone better off' and 'america great again'. In order to do exactly this he may begin by cutting the very thing he doesn't believe in... Climate Change. Tesla receives hordes of support from the government at present however with Trump not even sold on the idea, who's to say he doesn't turn around tomorrow and stop dishing out credits to firms battling this 'fantasy' as he puts it.

There are many other points to cover which I will in due discussion however these are a few of the key reasons why I believe Tesla is a solid short play. Although this is my opinion it is not financial advise and I wish to hear other peoples' opinions on both my own opinions and the future of Tesla. I have an abundance of respect for Musk. He is a fantastic man and is a complete visionary, however Rule 1 of trading is to ignore the heart and listen to the brain however hard they may repel in beliefs. 

p.s - Although Tesla may have been a good risk play in another scenario, I forgot to mention that it commands a forward P.E ratio of approx -80.5. This extreme premium for a company with such a long trail of risk. One last point before I force myself to stop - selling flamethrowers seems like an interesting way to raise capital but imo a stupid way, especially when you're the face of a multibillion dollar company. If a house burns down/someone is killed by one of these things Musk is gunna have a hell of a lot to answer for.",0

7u75we,1517371499,mcd,[Semi-OC] Who's the closest comparable this year to each Knick player?,"Welcome to my shitpost posing as semi-original content gleaned from using a new feature on someone else's website.

I came across a player comparison tool on fantasy basketball site [fb-ninja](http://www.fb-ninja.com/SimilarPlayers/).  It has an algorithm to determine who is the most similar player this season to any other player this season.  Caveat, looks like it's brand new and they still have it in beta.  

Out of curiosity I started entering in Knicks players to see what this quantitative approach would come up with, as we know fans tend to be emotional and overvalue their own players.  They give a whole list and similarity scores for each, but I'll keep it simple and just show the top comparable:

KP: Myles Turner

Frank: Tyler Ulis

Baker: DeAndre Liggins

Kanter: Jonas Valanciunas

THJ: Wes Mathhews

McD: Luke Babbitt

Lee: Malcom Brogdon

KOQ: Jordan Bell

Jack: Rondo

Willy:Miles Plumlee

Lance: Justin Anderson

Dotson: T.J. Leaf

Beasley: RoLo

Bonus - ex-Knick - Melo: Lauri Markkanen

I left off a few but you get the idea.  Enjoy and share thoughts on if any of this rings true and if so what light it sheds on our roster.

7u7kcd,1517375459,msft,"New PM is implementing ""agile/scrum"" process, but it seems we have more meetings now than ever.","This is a continuation of a post I made back in December.  

The TLDR; of the old post is previous PM left for a new job, new PM was hired from MSFT and is implementing agile/scrum process.  We had no issues delivering before, but new PM wants to do agile/scrum and he is in charge so we went along with it. [Old Post] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7kosm4/new_pm_came_in_and_is_making_overarching_process/)

So now after we have been doing this for a couple months it seems like we have more meetings now for scheduling things and not less.  I though the idea of agile/scrum was to reduce meetings and make people more efficient.  We use JIRA, but there are constant meetings with various SWEs each week so the PM can create the Epics/Stories/tasks for work we have to do.   

The team consists of a 12 SWEs where 8 has 7+ years experience.  So we all know what we need to do to get things done and the seniors on the team help the junior/mid-level people as needed.  I feel we are very self sufficient overall and don't need a lot of ""managing"".  Many people see these planning meetings as only helpful for the new PM and not the actual SWEs.  Much of these meetings is really getting the PM to understand what we are doing in details so he can fill out some JIRA story.

In terms of meetings there are:

* daily stand-ups
 * for 12 people it takes about 20 minutes to complete
 * the stand up consists of going over the sprint board in JIRA so the PM has status of everything
 * then everybody goes around and says there 30 second piece of yesterday/today

* weekly planning/grooming meetings
 * as new JIRA items are added the PM makes meetings with the appropriate person/people
 * the goal is to fill out all the details of the JIRA epic/story/task in the meeting for the backlog

* weekly ""shiproom"" meeting
 * basically a meeting where the PM talks about priorities for the current sprint
 * what we are planning to deliver in the current sprint to make sure everybody still agrees
 * he asks if people want to add or remove stuff to the sprint

* retrospective meeting
 * basically the PM talking about what was good/bad in the last sprint
 * where we could be ""better""

All these meetings seem to add up and take up at least 1 work day per week per person on average. 

Under the old PM we never had issues delivering and everybody knew what needed to happen.  Everybody was self sufficient as the team was hired to be that way.  There were general we want X features in the next controlled build type of goals, but it was more fluid of whatever is done will be in the next build on X date.  The old PM stayed on top of status just by hearing conversations people are having around him and talking to people.  There as a weekly status meeting and that's it.

The old PM was more hands off in the actual development and more people manager between the SWEs and management along with making sure the SWEs had information they needed to do their job.  He understood what people were doing enough to talk about it with management and answer all their questions.  In these cases the details are not as important as management wants to know big picture stuff.

The new PM seems to want to know all of these details because that's how he fills out these JIRA epic/stories/tasks so he knows in detail what everybody is doing basically every day.  I guess this creates a nice detailed schedule, but seems to create a lot more work for the SWEs to explain everything in detail to the new PM in meetings so he can create the JIRA stuff to his liking.

I guess the question I have is if this is a good implementation of agile/scrum?  I always thought meetings would be minimized, but we really have more meetings now than before.

Anyway I have about physical 14 buildings through out the US and I have close 1000 users total spread out and working in those buildings.

7u8c81,1517384897,nflx,Sold half my NFLX shares yesterday [ALL],"Sold about half my shares in Netflix yesterday. Lots of reasons... but mostly because of a gut feel on its shape. NFLX has spiked rather dramatically over the past week, and I feel like a correction might be coming.

I'm sharing this because those shares have been just amazing over the years. [I bought them at around $11 back in late 2011, and got (halfway) out at just over $280.](https://i.imgur.com/qmq0YWf.png) The gains from that single stock, are responsible for about 20% of the present value of my entire retirement nest egg.  I have another 30 years to go, and I don't expect that I'll ever see that level of performance in my portfolio again.  What a ride!

If I ever somehow cross paths with Reed Hastings, I owe that man ~~a beer~~ all the beer.",0

$HSBC directly came out and said they are laundering money for cartels, terrorists, the Mormons, the Sandemanians, and various other sinners, yet their stock has done nothing but go up and up and up. Do I even need to mention their robust dividend yield? ",0

7uak1c,1517411671,mcd,"After multiple heart issues, loss &amp; giving to others-- now I'm looking for help. I've reached my wit's end. This is the last hope.","Hello /r/Assistance,

I know you see many of these and the text is long, but I ask that you please read it, fully. I'm putting myself out there on a personal account, no longer hiding the reality of my failures.  For location, I am in the Orlando, FL area.

In the past few years (starting at age 39) I have suffered 2 heart attacks, had 1 triple bypass, lost most of my teeth and had a massive change in metabolism leading to increased weight gain. I lost a good job working IT for the state government and 2 years ago spent the last of the money I had saved. During the past 2 years, I sold all my electronics, my phone--everything, right down to space heaters, kitchen appliances and the collector plates my mom gave me over 20 years ago. The only things of value anymore are a scooter with 30,000+ miles and the 6 year old computer this is being posted from.

Add to all that my growing depression due to these issues, I feel it is detrimental to my mental and physical health. I worry it will kill me.

Previous to getting that state job, I had given much of my life to friends and family. From being a nanny for my best friend for 8 years, to living with my disabled grandfather for 2 years to most recently spending my time, effort and personal finances to keep a family-friendly gaming server running offering kids and their families a safe place to play online, for free. It's just been my nature to live altruistically. That's not a humble brag, it's just how I am wired. I get joy from giving.

For example, I was given one of the 3 McD's Szechuan Sauce bottles. Instead of selling it, I sent some to /u/OliverBabish of /r/bingingwithbabish fame (as well as about 350 other people) making no financial gain. I also gave up 5 years and tens of thousands of dollars to keep a gaming server up and running that was visited by more than a million Guests. I kept it going, out of pocket, to give something back.

I have tried to take control of my life. I kept thinking it would get better. The determination is there to face my issues, focus on my mental &amp; physical health and live a better, healthier and safer life. I just do not have the financial means to make it happen.

So, now I am asking for a little help from complete strangers because I am weary, worried &amp; constantly stressed. Just want a chance at a future. This is the most serious I have been about this in my life. I HAVE to be better. For me, for my family...for life.

Thank you all for your support.

**Note:** I do not have a paypal or bank account. All of those have been lost due to financial issues. I can, however, accept Western Union-- if that is allowed.

*Please respect my wishes to not judge me for this. It stresses me out enough to have to put this out there, make it a public post, beg and be open about suffering and failure.*

""AMD is executing on all fronts""
Sees 4Q as an ""inflection point in CPU market share"" and predicts that will continue into 2018
Says AMD’s forecast to 28% operating expense levels in 2018 ""is a bullish signal and perhaps opportunistic by AMD to take advantage of a vulnerable Intel""
Notes GPU cryptocurrency- specific demand was ~1/3 of upside to revenues; indicates broad- based new product demand
Year-over-year growth in computing and graphics suggests share gains seen vs. Intel in CPUs
Reiterates buy, raises PT to new Street-high of $27 from $22


**MORGAN STANLEY (Joseph Moore)**
Notes ""solid execution, results roughly in-line with the firm’s estimates, struggles to see earnings potential justifying stock price
Says crypto mining helped fuel the upside
Ethereum ""should continue to drive strong mining revenues""
Thinks mgmt is underestimating size of cryptocurrency exposure
Moore worries a deceleration in mining would bring reduction in units, ASPs in discrete graphics; that would be hard for product momentum in core business to offset
Reiterates underweight, PT $8


**SUSQUEHANNA (Christopher Rolland)**
Handily beat 4Q estimates on the back of crypto-related GPU sales
Believes crypto impact on sales ""grossly understated"" and a ""huge"" source of upside; believes 1Q guidance driven in large part by crypto-related GPU shipments after a record January
Sees crypto-related GPU sales now a ""significant part"" of both AMD and NVDA’s revenue
Says better-than-expected 1Q guidance ""totally obscured"" by accounting change
Reaffirms neutral, PT $13


**WELLS FARGO (David Wong)**
Earnings are poised for ""sustained profitability""
4Q sales beat likely helped ""in part by graphics demand for cryptocurrency applications""
Says AMD is positioned to show consistent market share gains through this year amid a solid lineup of new products that improve the co.’s position in desktop, notebook, server processors, graphics processor units
Reaffirms outperform, PT $18


**CITI (Christopher Danely)**
""Lofty valuation concerns us""
Maintains a sell rating due to lack of consistent profitability and valuation
Strong sales of new products spurred solid results, higher 1Q guidance but lack of consistent profitability, valuation remains a concern
Reaffirms sell, raises PT to $7

7ub15c,1517415566,nvda,If you spent the money on Nvidia stock instead of a GTX card...,"I'm sure you've seen article claiming if you bought $100 Apple stock back in 2000 you would have been siting on more than $5000 by now.

So back in summer of 2016 I was shopping for a graphic card for my new HTC Vive setup.  Seeing how difficult it was trying to get a hold of a 1080 founder's edition, I decided to postpone the purchase and invest the $700 into NVDA stock.  Back then it was about $45-50 a share, so that netted me a mere 14 shares.

Eventually I did find a 1080.  Today, price of 1080 has dropped since 1080ti came out, yet they are still somewhat difficult to get at MSRP.  But that 14 shares is now worth over $3500 as of today!  So even a Titan is now within reach!

Now I wished I never updated my PC for VR back then, and put all of the money into NVDA.  But hindsight being 20/20, I could also have missed out on all the fun this past 1.5 years.",0

7ucq57,1517428668,mcd,BBW’s mock draft 1.0,"This mock is under the scenario that Kirk goes to Arizona, and for the most part all other QB situations remain pretty much the same. ALSO, a lot of these picks are just fits I really like and are semi-realistic for the first round. This isn’t a big board or exactly what I think the Gm’s will do. Oh and no trades, just a simulation for fun. Let’s get started

1. CLE **Baker Mayfield**, Oklahoma QB
Any reasonable person would agree that comparisons between Manziel and Mayfield are ridiculous but nevertheless, they persist. What better way for Mayfield to smash that comparison then go first overall to the team that Manziel was drafted by to help guide them out of an 0-16 season? This dude is legit. Heisman winner, crazy stats, crazy athleticism. This is the guy Cleveland needs.

2. NYG **Josh Rosen**, UCLA QB
Gettleman and Shurmur are enthralled that probably the best QB prospect in the draft is available to them without having to trade up. Rosen is an awesome fit in the Big Apple and will have a few seasons to learn how to play and act like a pro under Eli.

3. IND **Saquon Barkley**, Penn State HB
Indy should probably trade out of here but since we’re going no trades it’s really between Saquon, Chubb, Nelson, and Fitzpatrick. Fitz doesn’t make sense with Hooker being taken last year (and taking a cornerback at 1.03 is stupid), so Ballard gets Josh McD a dynamic offensive weapon that can shoulder the offense of Luck gets hurt again. Pair this dude with Gore and Indy’s backfield looks good.

4. CLE **Minkah Fitzpatrick**, Alabama DB
Cleveland now has a dynamic safety duo with the Alabama product and Jabrill Peppers. Gregg Williams’ 3 safety package with those two and Kai Nacua will be filthy.

5. DEN **Lamar Jackson**, Louisville QB
LJ has the ceiling and personality to be the face of the league once Brady calls it quits. Denver is a face of the league team. I don’t know why I like this fit so much but I want to see Jackson at Mile High. Denver gets their QB early. 

6. NYJ **Sam Darnold**, USC QB
Jets manage to snag Darnold without trading up. A lot of people had the Jets drafting Darnold at 1.01 before the season. Despite exceeding season expectations, they still manage to get their guy. 4 QB’s in the top 6? Sheesh..

7. TB **Harold Landry**, Boston College DE/OLB
Another fit I just really dig. Smith would love Landry in that defense and he’d excel opposite Spence. Dude just seems like a Buc. Chubb’s drop continues..

8. CHI **James Washington**, Oklahoma State WR
Chi town needs a WR and Nagy gets the best in the draft. CB and WR are both weak is tits this year but da Bears and titty boy get the best of the latter group by far.

9. SF **Quenton Nelson**, Notre Dame G
I fuckin love Nelson and him dropping to 9 would be a scenario in which teams would be trying to trade up but Lynch is smart enough to know this dude will probably be a perennial pro bowler. Jimmy G and Carlos get a great guard who can start right away.

10. OAK **Denzel Ward**, Ohio State CB
Ward is reunited with his college teammate Conley for the Raiders final season in the Bay Area. It’s weird with the Raiders cornerbacks. Amerson and Smith were a good duo and now Amerson’s back to being average and Sean Smith fuckin internally combusted. Guenther’s got a good young CB duo to work with now.

11. MIA **Maurice Hurst**, Michigan DT
Really didn’t know where go here but Harris-Suh-Hurst-Wake is a damn good d line and new line coach Kocurek would love a high ceiling tackle like Hurst to work with. Solid BPA pick.

12. CIN **Roquon Smith**, Georgia ILB
Continuing the Georgia to Cinci pipeline, Smith goes to Cinci to help get the Bengals back to the playoffs. Really underrated prospect in my opinion.

13. WAS **Da’Ron Payne**, Alabama DT
Another BPA pick but I like this fit. Trading Fuller was fucking stupid so Washington will need a lot of pressure up front to succeed on D. Payne joins Bama teammate Jon Allen in Washington under one of the best positional coaches in the league in Jim Tomsula. When you can get a really solid prospect to learn and develop under a dude who should be coordinating a defense, you take that prospect.

14. GB **Conner Williams**, Texas OT
Just seems like a Green Bay pick. You can never have too many good linemen and Williams should be a good one.

15. ARI **Joshua Jackson**, Iowa CB
Joshua Jackson joins his spirit brother Josh Jackson in Arizona to play cornerback opposite Pat Pete and Tramon Williams in Wilks new D. This should help the Card’s defense return to the dominant form it should be at.

16. BAL **Derwin James**, Florida State DB
I don’t know why James isn’t higher on most people’s boards but whatever, Baltimore gets a top 10 prospect to play SS in their D and learn under Eric fucking Weddle. The rich get richer.

17. LAC **Vita Vea**, Washington DT
Vea stays in Pac-12 country. Mebanes getting old and a d line of Ingram-Liuget-Vea-Bosa is just unfair. I like this fit.

18. SEA **Derrius Guice**, Louisiana State HB
Look, I honestly don’t think the running backs were the cause of Seattle’s historically terrible run game last season, but it’d make sense to look to improve every possible aspect of it. Firing cable was a good start and taking Guice to compete with Lacy and Rawls isn’t a terrible idea either.

19. DAL **Orlando Brown**, Oklahoma OT
The cowboys fabled O line came back down to earth last season. The 3 biggies are still awesome and Collins still has upside but taking Brown to man the side opposite Smith would help a lot. I like Brown’s fit in Dallas and Oakland  a lot.

20. DET **Sam Hubbard**, Ohio State DE
I really don’t know who my team should take but I’m gonna go with Hubbard. Good 4-3 fit who sets the edge well. Big 10 guy. A poor man’s Bosa.

21. BUF **Billy Price**, Ohio State C
Eric wood having to retire fucking sucks but Buffalo wastes no time in drafting his replacement. I honestly liked Elflein more as a prospect but people have Billy going first round so I’ll role with it. Bills get their center.

22. BUF **Josh Allen**, Wyoming QB
r/NFL_Draft’s favorite son goes north of the wall to compete with T-Mobile. Good lord, the memes.

23. LAR **Bradley Chubb**, NC State OLB
Chubb’s freefall ends with Snead and McVay tripping over each other to get the pick sent in. The Son of Bum gets a guy to play opposite Quinn and learn under Barwin. Good fit.

24. CAR **Arden Key**, LSU DE
I really don’t care for key, my pro comp for him is Barkevious Mingo, but pass rushers are always a premium in the early rounds and the other guy I had going here—Deshon Elliot—might be available for them in the second. Plus their pass rushers are old as shit. Brady Hoke gets to prove he can develop players.

25. TEN **Courtland Sutton**, WR SMU
The tits don’t really need more wide receivers but Sutton just seems like a titan. Lafleur gets a present for leaving LA.

26. ATL **Lowell Lotulelei**, DT Utah
The ATL takes Star’s brother to add to their versatile d line. Oh boy the divisional matchups will be fun.

27. NO **Calvin Ridley**, WR Alabama
Same with Tennessee, NoLa doesn’t really need wideouts but we all know Michael Thomas or Snead will go down in the preseason and Drew will get this kid to put up 78/1250/10 or something stupid like that.

28. PIT **Malik Jefferson**, ILB Texas
Unfortunately it looks like Shazier is finished in the NFL. There’s nothing I like more than short, slow, hard-nosed linebackers who put up crazy stats in college but I don’t think Matakevich is the guy to take up the mantle, so Colbert takes a solid all around prospect who’s young and can defend the pass and run well to try and do it.

29. JAX **Mike McGlinchey**, OT Notre Dame
Ahh I love this fit. Jax got their left tackle with Cam Robinson last year but I want to see McGlinchey as a jag. Throw him on the right side and this offense gets noticeably better.

30. MIN **Tremaine Edmunds**, LB Vtech
Minnesota is set on linebackers with Barr, Kendrick’s, and Gedeon but Edmunds is a great coverage backer and BPA. Zim Zam’s D gets even better which it’ll need to with the turnover on offense.

31. PHI **Hercules Mata’afa**, DE Washington State
They’ve already got a shit load of pass rushers but some will leave in FA and Mata’afa is underrated and should transition to the pro game well.

32. NE **Marcus Davenport**, DE UTSA
Another fit I like. This kid just seems like a Pats pick. Can never have too many pass rushers.

I have a savings account with a 1.25% interest rate, which seems terrible to me after reading “The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need” (it was pretty good) where the author talks about ~8-10% interest rate Roth IRA’s.

I also have a little bit in the stock market, in which I got really, really lucky and bought 8 shares of NVDA in around November 2015 for ~32 which I kept until it hit 80, in which I sold 4 and bought 4 shares of NVS (it’s a long investment, my dad told me) and I still have 4 shares of NVDA which is at around 247 as of right now. I got lucky, lol.

I really just want some suggestions for other saving methods. I wouldn’t save enough to hit minimums for various mutual funds, unless there are good ones with no minimums that I don’t know about. So yeah, thanks in advance!

7uf3rg,1517448547,nflx,"Lucky, but now need your help!","Hey Reddit! Been checking out reddit for 4 years+ now--I guess it's time I finally post something! Hopefully I don't get reamed too hard and I am in the right spot...
&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp;



I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all regarding my portfolio.  I've really only started investing about 2 years ago and the purpose of this portfolio is just to buy and hold.  Every month I put about $1,000 into the account and and try and keep an evenISH balance across the portfolio.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

  
**Anyway, here's my concern.**   
I know that I've been very lucky to come into the market when I have, but I'm concerned that (1) that my portfolio is not as diversified as it should be and (2) when the market drops, I'll feel it harder than I should.  I blame it on the market lulling me into believing that I actually know what I'm doing when really a monkey probably outperformed me this year.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

   
So, without further ado, would you mind just taking a quick look at my current portfolio and letting me know your thoughts and concerns.  It would be greatly appreciated. Quick note that the a small handful of these holdings (the *italicized ones*) are from this week when I started realizing I'm way to tech heavy...

7uf3rg,1517448547,nvda,"Lucky, but now need your help!","Hey Reddit! Been checking out reddit for 4 years+ now--I guess it's time I finally post something! Hopefully I don't get reamed too hard and I am in the right spot...
&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp;



I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all regarding my portfolio.  I've really only started investing about 2 years ago and the purpose of this portfolio is just to buy and hold.  Every month I put about $1,000 into the account and and try and keep an evenISH balance across the portfolio.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

  
**Anyway, here's my concern.**   
I know that I've been very lucky to come into the market when I have, but I'm concerned that (1) that my portfolio is not as diversified as it should be and (2) when the market drops, I'll feel it harder than I should.  I blame it on the market lulling me into believing that I actually know what I'm doing when really a monkey probably outperformed me this year.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  

  

   
So, without further ado, would you mind just taking a quick look at my current portfolio and letting me know your thoughts and concerns.  It would be greatly appreciated. Quick note that the a small handful of these holdings (the *italicized ones*) are from this week when I started realizing I'm way to tech heavy...

7uf7qm,1517449593,mcd,Anyone heard about Texas Gun Club?,"So just yesterday I went to this brand new indoor range around the 59/Main area, and I was blown away I hadn't heard about it until my dad mentioned it while we were eating at the McD's nearby. 

20 lanes, 12 lanes have an automated target system that can run dynamic target programs. The lanes are wide enough for two people to stand side by side and the entire line is very well illuminated. The range staff was also very nice and accomodating even though I showed up an hour before closing with three other people.

I'm considering getting a membership since it's nice to have a range local to Stafford so I don't have to battle the traffic to Westheimer, Fountainview, or Highway 6.",0

So every time I make a contribution or get a dividend, the money would have gone into ua until my account had leveled to 50/50?

note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple’s softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO’s stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO’s lighter guidance, with the company’s shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO’s share price is its indication of “recent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins”, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm’s BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

In the last 2 years, MSFT has been doing very well, the stock has almost doubled ($95 today) and continues rising.

Apple has $163 billion to burn, and Tim Cook plans to spend it

That’s a lot of cash to spend on buybacks, capital expenditures, and potentially a few acquisitions

Apple Inc. left things vague last month when it announced a plan to invest money from its sizable cash balance into the U.S. economy, but the company was more direct about its plans Thursday — it’s going to spend more than $160 billion of its own money.

“Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net-cash neutral over time,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call.

Translated from corporate speak, that means Apple AAPL, +0.70%  plans to spend that $163 billion and eventually stop collecting huge stores of cash as it has over the past decade, when the company built up about $284 billion in cash reserves while using more than $100 billion in debt to fund shareholder returns and other activities. Pressed to elaborate on what “over time” actually meant, Maestri said Apple would say more in its next quarterly report, when the company typically updates its shareholder-return plans.

The bulk of that money will likely head right back to investors. The company added $50 billion to its shareholder-return plan last year for buybacks and dividends, increasing its program to about $300 billion, and announced a $50 billion increase the year before, as well. Maestri said the company typically returns approximately 100% of its free cash flow to investors, “so that is the approach that we’re going to be taking.”

If Apple decided to double its typical annual increase this spring, however, the company would still have $63 billion in net cash left to spend. There are a number of different ways that the company could use this money. Apple said in its January announcement that it would invest “over $10 billion” in data-center expansions. The company also set out to build a new campus and “create” 20,000 jobs — though it didn’t actually say whether it would hire 20,000 full-time Apple employees.

Apple could also spend some of its net-cash balance to scoop up other companies. Speaking to this point on Apple’s earnings call, Maestri implied that Apple wasn’t looking to change its strategy around acquisitions.

“The thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, [or] providing a new experience to customers,” he said, adding that Apple looks “at all sizes and we will continue to do so.”

Apple made 19 acquisitions in 2017, Maestri noted, but all are thought to be smaller purchases, which has been Apple’s typical approach. The company’s largest acquisition to date has been Beats, which it purchased for $3 billion back in 2014. Some have speculated that Apple might make a splashy move, buying Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.04%  or Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.67%  .

Those are well out of the company’s price range even if it only increases shareholder return by $50 billion, though, with market values of $115 billion and $167 billion, respectively, and that’s before factoring in the likely hefty premium one would have to pay to buy one of these giants. Apple will probably think smaller with its cash, looking for tuck-in acquisitions that add talent and give the company a base on which to build future product enhancements.

Investors hungry for a piece of that cash sent shares up more than 3% in late trading Thursday. The stock was already up 30.3% over the past 12 months, compared with a 31.6% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% , of which Apple is a component.

The company added $50 billion to its shareholder-return plan last year for buybacks and dividends, increasing its program to about $300 billion, and announced a $50 billion increase the year before, as well. Maestri said the company typically returns approximately 100% of its free cash flow to investors, “so that is the approach that we’re going to be taking.”

If Apple decided to double its typical annual increase this spring, however, the company would still have $63 billion in net cash left to spend. There are a number of different ways that the company could use this money. Apple said in its January announcement that it would invest “over $10 billion” in data-center expansions. The company also set out to build a new campus and “create” 20,000 jobs — though it didn’t actually say whether it would hire 20,000 full-time Apple employees.

Apple could also spend some of its net-cash balance to scoop up other companies. Speaking to this point on Apple’s earnings call, Maestri implied that Apple wasn’t looking to change its strategy around acquisitions.

“The thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, [or] providing a new experience to customers,” he said, adding that Apple looks “at all sizes and we will continue to do so.”

Apple made 19 acquisitions in 2017, Maestri noted, but all are thought to be smaller purchases, which has been Apple’s typical approach. The company’s largest acquisition to date has been Beats, which it purchased for $3 billion back in 2014. Some have speculated that Apple might make a splashy move, buying Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.04%  or Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.67%  .

Those are well out of the company’s price range even if it only increases shareholder return by $50 billion, though, with market values of $115 billion and $167 billion, respectively, and that’s before factoring in the likely hefty premium one would have to pay to buy one of these giants. Apple will probably think smaller with its cash, looking for tuck-in acquisitions that add talent and give the company a base on which to build future product enhancements.

Investors hungry for a piece of that cash sent shares up more than 3% in late trading Thursday. The stock was already up 30.3% over the past 12 months, compared with a 31.6% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% , of which Apple is a component.

Apple Inc. left things vague last month when it announced a plan to invest money from its sizable cash balance into the U.S. economy, but the company was more direct about its plans Thursday — it’s going to spend more than $160 billion of its own money.

“Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net-cash neutral over time,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the company’s earnings call.

Translated from corporate speak, that means Apple AAPL, +0.70%  plans to spend that $163 billion and eventually stop collecting huge stores of cash as it has over the past decade, when the company built up about $284 billion in cash reserves while using more than $100 billion in debt to fund shareholder returns and other activities. Pressed to elaborate on what “over time” actually meant, Maestri said Apple would say more in its next quarterly report, when the company typically updates its shareholder-return plans.

The bulk of that money will likely head right back to investors. The company added $50 billion to its shareholder-return plan last year for buybacks and dividends, increasing its program to about $300 billion, and announced a $50 billion increase the year before, as well.

---

Stocks opened deep in negative territory and the averages added to their losses as the session continued. The weakness was attributed to higher bond yields, global profit-taking and disappointing quarterly reports from a few of the biggest names in technology. The move lower was broad based with each of the major averages losing roughly 2%.

**The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 2.5%, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.1% and 2.0%, respectively**, but the three major indices still hold year-to-date gains between 3.2% and 4.9%. Equities opened Friday with sizable losses and extended those losses throughout the session, finishing at session lows.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 9 to 1 at the New York Stock Exchange. **In terms of S&amp;P 500 sectors, 11 of 11 finished in negative territory**, with the energy space (-4.1%) pacing the retreat following fourth quarter earnings from CVX and XOM. Both companies missed revenues estimates; Exxon missed profit estimates as well. In addition, a decline in the price of crude oil also weighed on the sector; West Texas Intermediate crude futures slid 0.8% to $65.30 per barrel. The consumer discretionary sector (-0.9%), which houses Amazon, was among the top-performing groups.

The top-weighted technology sector (-3.0%) also had a rough outing, with AAPL, GOOGL , and V losing between 3.8% and 5.3%. **Shares of AAPL dropped 4.3% following last night's report of quarterly results and guidance from the iPhone maker**. In the wake of the report, KeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves downgraded Apple to Sector Weight saying he sees ""little to drive upside,"" while Bernstein analyst A.M. ""Toni"" Sacconaghi, Jr. cut his rating on Apple to Market Perform. 

Meanwhile, GOOGL Class A shares fell roughly 5.3% following the earnings report from Google's parent, with Citi analyst Mark May saying margin pressure overshadowed ""solid"" revenue growth in Q4. His peer at Stifel, Scott Devitt, downgraded Alphabet to Hold following last night's report. On a positive note, AMZN jumped 2.9%, touching a new intraday record, after soundly beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, thanks in large part to changes in the U.S. tax code. 

Among the notable winners was MAT, which surgedsurged 7.9% even after the toy maker posted a steep sales decline during its important holiday period. Among the notable losers was PI, which fell 46.8% after it reduced its outlook for Q1 and said its CFO will step down, prompting multiple downgrades of the stock. 

It's also worth pointing out that the CBOE Volatility Index, often referred to as the ""investor fear gauge,"" spiked about four points, or 29.0%, on Friday to 17.40--its highest level since the U.S. presidential election on November 8, 2016.

In the Asia-Pacific region, equity indices had a mixed outing with Japan's Nikkei (-0.9%) showing relative weakness. China's Shanghai Composite was the top performer, adding 0.46%.

U.S. Treasuries ended a down week on a lower note with longer durations bearing the brunt of today's weakness. The trading day began with modest losses, but the selling picked up after the release of a better than expected Employment Situation report for January (200K), which showed that average hourly earnings increased 2.9% year-over-year, marking the sharpest growth rate since 2009. **The yield on the benchmark 10-yr Treasury note spiked 19 basis points to 2.85% this week, its best level since January 2014, while the 2-yr yield climbed two basis points to 2.14%, its best level in nearly a decade--dating back to the financial crisis.**

7uwef5,1517622758,aapl,Dow plunges 600 points -- worst week in 2 years - Will Trump Take Credit For It?,"Wall Street just suffered the worst day of the Trump presidency.
The Dow closed down 666 points, or 2.5%, its biggest percentage decline since the Brexit turmoil in June 2016 and steepest point decline since the 2008 financial crisis.

A strong jobs report showed wage growth is finally starting to pick up. That's great news for workers, but it reinforced investors' concern about inflation and the bond market.

""It's all about rates. Asset prices and the economy have become addicted to low rates,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Financial Group. ""Sentiment got euphoric. There is more froth that needs to be taken off.""

The sell-off knocked the Dow well below 26,000. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 suffered their biggest weekly drops since early 2016 -- roughly 4% each.

Political turmoil is adding to the uncertainty. Market analysts pointed to the clash between the Trump administration and the FBI as another concern.

""There looks like a breakdown of the institutions in our country,"" said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. ""No matter what side you're on, that's not good.""

While the point decline on the Dow was large, it paled in comparison with the scary days of the financial crisis. Friday's decline was 2.5%. The Dow plummeted nearly 8% on a single day in October 2008.

The stock market is much calmer these days, thanks to a strong economy, record corporate profits and the huge business tax cut enacted by President Trump and Republicans in Congress.

Even with this week's slump, the S&amp;P 500 is just 3.9% below its all-time high.

But the tranquility that has defined Wall Street's stunning rally since the election has been punctured. The VIX (VIX), a measure of market volatility, soared 55% this week.

Related: Alan Greenspan - 'We have a stock market bubble'

January's jobs report didn't settle the market down. The economy added 200,000 jobs in January, and wages grew at the fastest pace in eight years.

But if wages grow too fast, they could eat into Corporate America's record profit margins.

The other concern: Wage growth could be a sign that inflation, which has been mysteriously low for years, may heat up. That would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than investors may be comfortable with.

Those worries are showing up in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield reached a four-year high of 2.85% on Friday. It was at about 2.4% at the start of the year.

bond yields soaring
Some investors are worried rates could climb high enough to slow the economy by raising borrowing costs. They also worry that higher returns on bonds will make stocks look less attractive by comparison.

""Those rising rates are making it harder to say there is no alternative to stocks,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.

Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said this week that both stocks and bonds are in a ""bubble.""

Related: Are GE's days on the Dow numbered?

Of course, this week's slide does little to dent the overall gains the market has achieved since President Trump's victory. The Dow and the Nasdaq have climbed more than 40% apiece since the 2016 election. The S&amp;P 500 has advanced for 10 consecutive months. That hasn't happened since 1959.

Even stock market bulls have long said that a pause -- or even a dip -- would help prevent the market from overheating.

""We've just gone too far, too fast,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. ""We had this perfection of 2% higher every week -- and that really is just not reality.""

Some market analysts said the political controversy over the release of the disputed GOP memo is rattling Wall Street. ""You've got trouble in the Department of Justice and the FBI at the senior level,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James.

""It all hit when the market was ready to go down anyway. It just accelerated it,"" Saut said.

Wedbush's Winer said the biggest risk is that Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, is fired.

""If Bob Mueller is challenged in a firing, or a prelude to a firing, then you're going to have a problem,"" he said.

Other market analysts think Friday's drop has little to do with Washington.

""We're not drawing a connection between the political headlines and the market. Valuations for stocks are high, and we were due for a pullback,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust.

Related: Here's who's getting a raise these days

The latest corporate earnings, which typically drive stock prices, left the markets unimpressed.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) slumped 5% even after the tech behemoth posted its first $100 billion sales year. Disappointing iPhone sales left Apple (AAPL) down 4%. ExxonMobil (XOM) sank 5% after its results widely missed expectations.

Selling was widespread. Amazon was one of just 27 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day higher.

""You've had a stock market that's gone absolutely crazy based on tax reform juicing earnings,"" said Winer. ""And numbers are coming in that are OK, but not blowing the doors off.""

The question now is whether this market turmoil will persist into next week, or whether investors have been waiting on the sidelines come in to buy after the dip.

Tilley said his team expects there will finally be a full-blown correction -- a 10% pullback from the recent highs.

""But don't expect a bear market unless there's an actual downturn in the economy,"" Tilley added.",0

7ux9zr,1517632865,msft,"Want Windows 7 back? I did it on a modern ""incompatible"" PC, and it's worth it!","I've been putting off a long overdue PC upgrade for years hoping that knowledge would become more present about upgrading back to Windows 7. The amount of bugs in 10, obfuscation of OS functionality, forced updates, reporting on users, etc makes me sick. So I spent weeks finding all the drivers for a modern PC so I could wait another 10 years for Windows to come up with a solution to the disaster they've created with Windows 10. 

Intel told me this couldn't be done, but it can. HP told me this was the only thing their tech support isn't allowed to help with, probably because MSFT wants to force windows 10 down people's throats, just like their updates.

If you too have been waiting to upgrade, I would highly recommend jumping on this setup before later processor/hardware changes make it even more difficult.

PC: The current HP Spectre x360 13t touch. 16GB ram, 1TB HD, 8th Gen Quad core processor (8 virtual cores), and thin/sexy as hell. $1560 if you get a good phone rep and ask for the discount (knocked off $100 bucks). The versions with less power are cheaper.

Downsides: I haven't found a working touchscreen driver. Everything else works flawlessly. Reward offered for anyone who can find a working one.

1) Pre-download all the drivers from HP's website and put them on the flash drive from step 2.

2) This was the most annoying part. You will need to create a bootable USB-drive with Windows using Rufus or Windows' bootable media creation tool.

There are instructions out there for adding the USB-3.0 drivers to the windows installer. Here's a great one: http://codeabitwiser.com/2014/03/how-to-install-windows-7-with-only-usb-3-0-ports/ You will need to do this or else the flash drive won't be visible from the windows bootloader. You will also need the driver for the solid state drive so Windows can see it. Intel SSD's will work with their NVMe drivers, very easily. Toshiba SSD's you'll need to add this hotfix: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2990941/update-to-add-native-driver-support-in-nvm-express-in-windows-7-and-wi to add NVME support (note: with no drivers, just the hotfix) to the Windows 7 installation media. Only after Windows is installed, you can put the Z3 or RD400 driver from Toshiba and either will work.

3) All the HP drivers from the HP site work perfectly despite claiming they are for Windows 10. None of the Intel drivers work, with the exception of the wireless one I think.

4) You need two remaining very important drivers, the USB-C one, and the video card. For the video card one, you modify one line to fake out the driver for the video card one generation older and tell it that it's for Windows 7. Works flawlessly. Instructions: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Software-and-How-To-Questions/HP-Spectre-Win-7-Drivers/td-p/6546432/

# **WEEK AHEAD: Scary Friday could lead to scary Monday for markets** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.
*****
&gt; ""How long has it has been since we've had a scary Friday, and a whole scary weekend until we see what Monday is like?"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""The other thing that got me, leading up to this week, is that good news stopped helping stocks.""
*****
&gt; The stock market sell-off was tied to a sell-off in bonds, and bond strategists were reluctant to call a direction for interest rates in the week ahead, after the unusual volatility of the past week.
*****
&gt; ""The sell-off has been pretty violent,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ""Normally I'd say if you have some 40 basis point move in the 10-year, it's better looking for long-term investors.""
*****
&gt; But that may not be clear until trading opens up again in the Asian session early Monday, and really not until the markets move past the Treasurys $66 billion in auctions of 3-, 10-year and 30-year bonds, Tuesday through Thursday.
*****
&gt; This past week, the Treasury announced higher issuance at those auctions, and that also spooked bonds, which have been anticipating a surge in new debt this year.
*****
&gt; Jerome Powell is sworn in as Fed chair Monday, after Janet Yellen leaves the post over the weekend. There are a number of Fed speakers in the coming week, and they may have comments about inflation but the markets are mostly looking forward to the Fed forecasts after its March meeting and Powell's comments at his first press briefing after that meeting.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had also been rising on inflation expectations and the idea that the Fed and other central banks could raise interest rates and tighten policy. But then the January employment report Friday included the best wage gains since 2009. That sent rates spiking, and the 10-year jumped to 2.85 percent, its highest level since January 2014.
*****
&gt; ""The market obviously got a little ahead of itself and all it took was the sell-off in bonds to show us that. Meanwhile, earnings are fine,"" said Bob Doll, chief U.S. equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""Tell me where the 10-year yield is going to end up in this noisy period. If it stops going up, stocks will probably stop going down.""
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market is adjusting to the idea that the Fed could have to raise interest rates more than the three times it forecast for this year.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said ifthe 10-year gets close to 3 percent that could be problematic for stocks. ""If yields stop here, this correction is likely going to be one of a combination of price and time correction ... sideways choppy, volatile for a number of weeks but not material downside. But if politics stay in the headlines and rates continue to rise, that's how you get the big move to the downside.""
*****
&gt; Washington will continue to be a focus as Congress faces a Feb. 8 budget deadline and markets watch for fallout from the House intelligence committee release of a GOP memo on the Russian investigation.

# A Big January Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “So goes January, goes the year.” With stocks seeing one of the best January returns ever, it is time to take a closer look at the January barometer. The January barometer was first discussed by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac in 1972. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year and vice versa if we see a red January.

&gt; Looking at the numbers confirms that when the S&amp;P 500 Index is green in January the rest of the year (final 11 months) is up 12.2% on average, well above the average return of 7.9% over the final 11 months of the year; but when that first month is red the final 11 months are up only 1.2% on average. According to Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5% (like 2018 is on track to be), the return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?w=522&amp;h=213))**

*****

&gt; Of course we don’t suggest simply investing based on what the first month does, but with the overall global economic backdrop and corporate earnings growth as strong as it appears to be, this is yet another sign that 2018 may see a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% at the end of January, the full year return has never been negative (higher 12 out of 12 times); but it is worth noting that they weren’t smooth rides. The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7%, while the smallest intra-year pullback was -4.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/january-momentum-can-lead-to-continued-gains.png?w=522&amp;h=436))**

&gt; As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary, we are on the lookout for added volatility in 2018 as the economic cycle ages, but we would use any pullbacks to add to portfolio positions. This study is another example as to why we expect the bull to continue, but to be ready for a potentially bumpy ride.

# Why Midterm Years Can Slip Up Bull Markets

&gt; Equities were met with tremendous success during the first year of President Trump’s term, but now we’re headed into the much more historically troublesome midterm year. As Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist notes, “Midterm years tend to be a banana peel for markets, as they see the largest pullbacks out of the four-year presidential cycle. However, those who hang on for the ride tend to see a significant bounce over the next year.”

&gt; Taking a closer look, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been down 16.9% on average at its intra-year low during midterm years, though it tends to bounce back, posting an impressive 32.0% average gain over the subsequent twelve months.

*****

&gt; Now take a look at all of the midterm years and how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the intra-year lows were made:

&gt; The action over the past year has been historic on many levels, but we have our concerns as the bull market continues to move higher. In our next Weekly Market Commentary, due out later today, we will list some of the amazing streaks which make the recent market action truly special, but we will also look at a few other potential near-term worries which could trigger some long overdue volatility.

# **WEEK AHEAD: Scary Friday could lead to scary Monday for markets** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.

&gt; ""How long has it has been since we've had a scary Friday, and a whole scary weekend until we see what Monday is like?"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""The other thing that got me, leading up to this week, is that good news stopped helping stocks.""
*****
&gt; The stock market sell-off was tied to a sell-off in bonds, and bond strategists were reluctant to call a direction for interest rates in the week ahead, after the unusual volatility of the past week.
*****
&gt; ""The sell-off has been pretty violent,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ""Normally I'd say if you have some 40 basis point move in the 10-year, it's better looking for long-term investors.""
*****
&gt; But that may not be clear until trading opens up again in the Asian session early Monday, and really not until the markets move past the Treasurys $66 billion in auctions of 3-, 10-year and 30-year bonds, Tuesday through Thursday.
*****
&gt; This past week, the Treasury announced higher issuance at those auctions, and that also spooked bonds, which have been anticipating a surge in new debt this year.
*****
&gt; Jerome Powell is sworn in as Fed chair Monday, after Janet Yellen leaves the post over the weekend. There are a number of Fed speakers in the coming week, and they may have comments about inflation but the markets are mostly looking forward to the Fed forecasts after its March meeting and Powell's comments at his first press briefing after that meeting.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had also been rising on inflation expectations and the idea that the Fed and other central banks could raise interest rates and tighten policy. But then the January employment report Friday included the best wage gains since 2009. That sent rates spiking, and the 10-year jumped to 2.85 percent, its highest level since January 2014.
*****
&gt; ""The market obviously got a little ahead of itself and all it took was the sell-off in bonds to show us that. Meanwhile, earnings are fine,"" said Bob Doll, chief U.S. equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""Tell me where the 10-year yield is going to end up in this noisy period. If it stops going up, stocks will probably stop going down.""
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market is adjusting to the idea that the Fed could have to raise interest rates more than the three times it forecast for this year.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said ifthe 10-year gets close to 3 percent that could be problematic for stocks. ""If yields stop here, this correction is likely going to be one of a combination of price and time correction ... sideways choppy, volatile for a number of weeks but not material downside. But if politics stay in the headlines and rates continue to rise, that's how you get the big move to the downside.""
*****
&gt; Washington will continue to be a focus as Congress faces a Feb. 8 budget deadline and markets watch for fallout from the House intelligence committee release of a GOP memo on the Russian investigation.

# A Big January Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “So goes January, goes the year.” With stocks seeing one of the best January returns ever, it is time to take a closer look at the January barometer. The January barometer was first discussed by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac in 1972. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year and vice versa if we see a red January.

&gt; Looking at the numbers confirms that when the S&amp;P 500 Index is green in January the rest of the year (final 11 months) is up 12.2% on average, well above the average return of 7.9% over the final 11 months of the year; but when that first month is red the final 11 months are up only 1.2% on average. According to Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5% (like 2018 is on track to be), the return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?w=522&amp;h=213))**

*****

&gt; Of course we don’t suggest simply investing based on what the first month does, but with the overall global economic backdrop and corporate earnings growth as strong as it appears to be, this is yet another sign that 2018 may see a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% at the end of January, the full year return has never been negative (higher 12 out of 12 times); but it is worth noting that they weren’t smooth rides. The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7%, while the smallest intra-year pullback was -4.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/january-momentum-can-lead-to-continued-gains.png?w=522&amp;h=436))**

&gt; As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary, we are on the lookout for added volatility in 2018 as the economic cycle ages, but we would use any pullbacks to add to portfolio positions. This study is another example as to why we expect the bull to continue, but to be ready for a potentially bumpy ride.

# Why Midterm Years Can Slip Up Bull Markets

&gt; Equities were met with tremendous success during the first year of President Trump’s term, but now we’re headed into the much more historically troublesome midterm year. As Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist notes, “Midterm years tend to be a banana peel for markets, as they see the largest pullbacks out of the four-year presidential cycle. However, those who hang on for the ride tend to see a significant bounce over the next year.”

&gt; Taking a closer look, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been down 16.9% on average at its intra-year low during midterm years, though it tends to bounce back, posting an impressive 32.0% average gain over the subsequent twelve months.

*****

&gt; Now take a look at all of the midterm years and how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the intra-year lows were made:

&gt; The action over the past year has been historic on many levels, but we have our concerns as the bull market continues to move higher. In our next Weekly Market Commentary, due out later today, we will list some of the amazing streaks which make the recent market action truly special, but we will also look at a few other potential near-term worries which could trigger some long overdue volatility.

7v0ve6,1517680750,aapl,"""Day trading"" strategy for &lt;$25k?","If you have a &lt;$25k account, day trading regulations substantially limit your ability to hedge your risk... if you take a risky position that goes against you, you're SOL for the most part, especially if you're at your day trade limit.

You could take another approach, though.  If you look at the 1 or 5 minute charts for the Dow, Nasdaq, or SP500, there are a lot of little runs in the price.  I didn't measure a ton of them, but they seem to average around 0.3%.

You could grab the 3x short ETFs at the top of these runs and the 3x long ETFs at the bottom.  You'd have a 0.9% profitable spread between them.  You are locked into this difference as long as you hold these two (not considering decay and ETF fees, which should be minimal on the short-term).

Because there are a lot of these runs, you could spread your risk out among maybe 4-5 of them throughout the day, so if (when) some go wrong, you can recover.  The next day, you can wait for another one of the 0.3% runs, and sell the shorts low and the longs high.  So you make 0.9% on average on both sides of the trade you previously locked in.  Now you're locked out of re-buying with that index, and you can switch to a different one (Nasdaq, Dow, and SP500 all have single, double, triple leveraged direct and inverse ETFs).

What's also nice is if, while building your spread, you repeatedly screw it up, and actually build a negative spread (locking yourself into a loss), you can simply carry it into the next day.  You then have a chance to turn it into a profitable spread when you unlock it by selling the longs higher and the shorts lower.  So you get a second bite at the aapl.

Even if you made a number of mistakes and only locked in a 0.1% spread (extremely small and easy to manage), triple leverage turns that into 0.3% spread, and the next day you can make 0.3% on both the short half and the long half of that spread.  Or if, say the price gapped up significantly overnight, and you're now at +1.5% on your longs and -1.2% on your shorts, you could take the -1.2% loss at the bottom of a .3% run and let the longs run up it to 1.8%, maintaining that 0.6% (percentages are approximated as a lot of factors will make this example not as clean as I have listed).

Every time I think I have a good strategy, though, it's actually because I'm just forgetting some big catch, and I'm actually an idiot.  What am I missing with this?

7v1jd0,1517686812,nflx,"Beating a dead horse, Ackman and Herbalife","I know this is kind of an old subject but I just watched the NFLX documentary on it and remember very vividly when this was all happening. Upon further research he transferred his short position into derivatives (long puts) yet the stock has continued to soar. Funniest part is, he so brazenly called out Herbalife yet lost his ass supporting Valeant, which was one of the biggest frauds I've ever seen.  

Here's the kicker, I'm sure in his mind he's thinking ""OK I'm short, I'm donating proceeds to charity and I need to make a public fuss about this in order to expedite the demise of Herbalife"". What he failed to realize is.. people don't freakin like Ackman, he's a snide, arrogant little prick. My uncle is a managing director at Citi bank and plays tennis with him, tells me the guy is so far up his own ass he might as well set up camp. 

All that aside, Herbalife is a clear cut pyramid scheme or at least they were until dopey came out and publicly called for them to be burnt at the stake. The FTC would have taken notice if he acted more subtly and passed along information quietly instead of making a huge fuss publicly. Instead Herbalife got advanced notice to change their business model, and fast, or else.. I just looked at their website and here are the stipulations for being a distributor;

As an Herbalife Independent Distributor, you can earn money by:
• Selling Herbalife products that you buy at a discount. 
• Sponsoring someone who either sells Herbalife products or purchases them at a discount for their own or household use. 
• **You cannot earn money simply for recruiting or sponsoring someone.** 

Distributor Refund Policy: 
**If Distributorship is canceled for any reason, you may return all unopened products that were purchased in the previous 12 months for a full refund.** To obtain a refund, Distributors may call Herbalife at 866-866-4744 or submit the refund form available at MyHerbalife.com. 

The bold print is clearly new as this is the exact opposite of what they were heavily promoting in the past, funny how a few sentences can push you from pyramid scheme to legitimate business model..


So Herbalife gets to continue this elaborate ruse, their stock continues to soar and Ackman is left, once again, looking like the pompous, ignorant brat that his reputation precedes. Sad part is, he was right, 110% on point but he had to make this big show of it. I think Herbalife would be a completely different story right now if he exercised just a little more discretion in his campaign against them. 

So what's in the cards for Herbalife's future, who knows, I'm not an arrogant prick like Ackman that GUARANTEES the stock will go to zero. But I can say that they are low-key right back to their bold and deceptive practices, just making sure it looks totally legit on the surface. IE. their latest report stating that 89% of distributors were making money but manipulated the numbers and didn't account for almost 200k of them, bringing that number closer to 19%. A very bold move in the wake of FTC sanctions, I damn sure wouldn't go long but I'm not making any big bets short either.. I think the best move is no move on Herbalife at least until more of the puzzle pieces fit into place. ",0
7v1lwu,1517687429,msft,"Want Windows 7 back? I did it on a modern ""incompatible"" PC, and it's worth it!","I've been putting off a long overdue PC upgrade for years hoping that knowledge would become more present about upgrading back to Windows 7. The amount of bugs in 10, obfuscation of OS functionality, forced updates, reporting on users, etc makes me sick. So I spent weeks finding all the drivers for a modern PC so I could wait another 10 years for Windows to come up with a solution to the disaster they've created with Windows 10. 

Intel told me this couldn't be done, but it can. HP told me this was the only thing their tech support isn't allowed to help with, probably because MSFT wants to force windows 10 down people's throats, just like their updates.

If you too have been waiting to upgrade, I would highly recommend jumping on this setup before later processor/hardware changes make it even more difficult.

PC: The current HP Spectre x360 13t touch. 16GB ram, 1TB HD, 8th Gen Quad core processor (8 virtual cores), and thin/sexy as hell. $1560 if you get a good phone rep and ask for the discount (knocked off $100 bucks). The versions with less power are cheaper.

Downsides: I haven't found a working touchscreen driver. Everything else works flawlessly. Reward offered for anyone who can find a working one.

1) Pre-download all the drivers from HP's website and put them on the flash drive from step 2.

2) This was the most annoying part. You will need to create a bootable USB-drive with Windows using Rufus or Windows' bootable media creation tool. Good .iso's: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6bNnleDp7llcGdMR3FEcjRjTGM. Verified checksums: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/how-to-obtain-a-windows-7-iso-file-to-create-an/59ef6586-f881-40b7-9070-e7950e057143?auth=1. There are instructions out there for adding the USB-3.0 drivers to the windows installer. Here's a great one: http://codeabitwiser.com/2014/03/how-to-install-windows-7-with-only-usb-3-0-ports/ You will need to do this or else the flash drive won't be visible from the windows bootloader. You will also need the driver for the solid state drive so Windows can see it. Intel SSD's will work with their NVMe drivers, very easily. Toshiba SSD's you'll need to add this hotfix: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2990941/update-to-add-native-driver-support-in-nvm-express-in-windows-7-and-wi to add NVME support (note: with no drivers, just the hotfix) to the Windows 7 installation media. Only after Windows is installed, you can put the Z3 or RD400 driver from Toshiba and either will work.

3) All the HP drivers from the HP site work perfectly despite claiming they are for Windows 10. None of the Intel drivers work, with the exception of the wireless one I think.

4) You need two remaining very important drivers, the USB-C one, and the video card. For the video card one, you modify one line to fake out the driver for the video card one generation older and tell it that it's for Windows 7. Works flawlessly. Instructions: https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Software-and-How-To-Questions/HP-Spectre-Win-7-Drivers/td-p/6546432/

7v1ono,1517688125,gme,Another question about universal gravitation,"The question asks me this:

A 12 kg meteor experiences an acceleration of 7.2 m/s^2 , when falling towards the earth. 

a) How high above the earths surface is the meteor?

b) What force will a 30 kg meteor experience at the same altitude?

This is my first physics course ever (its taken online) and I haven't done any math for 3 years. I should probably know how to do some of this but I cant figure it out.

My attempt at solving part a:

g= Gme/r^2 

r^2 = Gme/g

r= sqrt Gme/g

r= sqrt (6.67 x 10^-11 )(5.98 x 10^24 ) / 7.2

I'm pretty sure I set everything up the right way but I cant figure out how to get the answer. My calculator gives me errors when I try to plug the numbers in and I don't know how to do this on paper. If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be great!

7v24vy,1517692365,msft,Serious dip buying discussion thread,"Ok this week was a fucking blood bath and I'm not trying to catch a knife with the rest of my cash that I have on the sidelines - no point in degenerate gambling on calls (maybe puts though lol) right now since almost every single close this week was a fucking plunge into weakness with stupid amounts of selling instead of a strong close with buying volume. 

that means big money was not interested in buying the fucking dip...and right now, judging by the news and market sentiment, I don't see a reason they will BTFD next week either (I can see a deadcat bounce on tuesday which could be a good put buying opportunity thou if monday is another 1% plunge - watch the futures when they open back up tomorrow, could be a key sign as they were on the spot last week)

So, I think its just smart to wait out the storm which could be a week .. could be a month..either way its still a bull market and this will reverse as its always done in the past...just watch for strong buying volume and watch the daily/weekly charts and see when we have hit a floor...then wait for confirmation and uptrend signals...thats when it will be safest to enter back imo...bond/yields need to stabilize as well so keep an eye on that.

Theres going to be a serious BTFD opportunity that could be a game changer for everyones portfolios... so lets try to discuss somethings on buying calls? (shares work, but dude, get options enabled, seriously)

1) what kind of expiry y'all thinking about?

I'm thinking for shorter dated leaps (jan 2019)..anyone confident on quarterlies/monthlies? I don't like whats brewing for march/april with the fed meeting but it looks like the market is pricing it in now....also treasuries yield has not stopped gaining which makes me think we need to play it safer and wait for it to find a top and hope it settles..



2) wtf do i buy though?

slow and steady movers are the way to go imo..Visa, MSFT, JPM/BAC....non meme shit that won't get fucking dicked on by bullshit news/analyst/volatile markets like MU/AMD....I think these slightly OTM calls on those type of companies (or the indices) are solid bets like a $105 strike jan 19 MSFT ...not to expensive either...financial sector should remain great as people are spending money since they are making money..more loans..better interest rates..economy is stable for the most part..lot of positives in financials imo..anyone got some different opinions? maybe something in health care since they got a little extra beat down with the JPM/buffet/bezos threesome? or fuck it and go with meme shit anyways lol? AMD might actually have momentum this year

I want to know what everyone power rankings are currently and more importantly why you placed the teams where you did. 


Personal power rankings 

1) London - The only reason I'm putting London above NY is because the beat Seoul better then NY did. Top spot for me would be decided when NY and London play next week.

2) ‎NY - ^

3) ‎Houston - I honestly think Houston is a better team then Seoul is right now. The only reason I believe they lost against Seoul is because Fleta carried so hard and they were without Linkzr. With Linkzr this would be a different game. 

4) ‎Seoul - Seem to be in a slight slump. Having Fleta will keep them afloat though

5) ‎Boston - Beat LAV convincingly showing that they're a strong team. If they had this turn around earlier in the season they could probably be top 3. Boston is a team to look out for.

6) ‎LAV - Hard lost to Boston. LAV is a strong team that will no doubt turn things back around as the season goes on. They have the skill to be a top tier team. 

7) ‎Philly - Philly is an on and off team. They have times were they look like a top 3 team. And times they look very lackluster. With more coachings and more time under there belt I believe they have the potential to be top 6 team.

8) ‎LAG - Same as Philly. They have some good moments and some bad ones. They have things to work on and if they do get better, LAG can be a top team. 

9) ‎Dallas - A team with a great history and fanbase that's been nothing but disappointing so far. People always say, ""Well wait until next stage without Mercy"" or ""Wait until next META,"" but that's not an excuse. A team needs to be able to adapt to whatever changes happen, especially an OWL team with their history. A team that's been together as long as they have shouldn't have communication issues and straight up can't play dive. As a longtime fan of this team I want them to do better because we all know that they can. 

10) ‎SF - SF needs a better main tank and supports. Their play has not been good and Sinatraa and Super won't change that. There DPS and off-tanks aren't the issue. 

11) ‎McD - TviQ is good. We all know that. He just needs better teammates around him. The team has the potential but they haven't shown any of that recently. They're game against SF really shows that. It also doesn't help that they have no support staff.  

12) ‎SHD - They're improving. Still haven't won but they're improving, which honestly is the most important thing for them right now. I don't see them beating any of the top teams this season but if they continue to improve they can probably push their way up the power rankings to the middle of the pack

7vcniz,1517808659,msft,Investing for practicing Muslim - ETFs with general exposure but excludes all financial and food?,"(This post was deleted because my account was not 24hrs old so reposting)

So I have a bit of a weird scenario. I'm Muslim so I can't invest in any company who makes money through interest (which is like 99.99% of all banks). Also, can't invest in anything to do with food/meat (at least not non-halal meat) or alcohol related. ~~The interest means I'm also locked out of bonds.~~

I found some so called ""Ex-Financial"" etfs but then looked at the holdings and it had something like 5% financial which kind of pissed me off.

My plan is to save aggressively for retirement (20-25 years) and I've about 5k in RH and plan to add about 10k more over the next week months. My current holdings are in various ETFs (IGV, IBB, ROBO, XLI, SOXX) and a heavy tilt on tech stocks (AMZN, MSFT, NFLX, FB, NVDA). I also have XLK but realized yesterday it has some financial holdings so will be selling that. Will probably need to take a closer look at my other ones as well.



I need an ETF that is the equivalent of the SPY but doesn't include ANY finance or food. Am I just better off buying individual stock or copy SPY holdings manually (seems kind of unrealistic given I probably can't afford 1 stock of each SPY holding).

I would hope this helps other muslims who are lurking on this subreddit.

EDIT: not sure why all my comments are being downvoted...someone obviously has a problem with my faith. Oh well.

EDIT2: I'm allowed to buy bonds from non-muslim banks. See comment below.",1

Given how major of an acquisition Netflix got with Cloverfield Paradox, and how they dropped the trailer almost out of nowhere during the Super Bowl, it is definitely amazing observing the innovative aspect of how major productions like this is utilizing Netflix and guerrilla marketing campaigns to get the audience all in, and it is really effective.

For example: QUALITY AFTERMARKET HITCHES ARE 
Hidden when not in use
Reduce rusting
Has no movement at stops and starts 
No visible cutting into vehicle

Our beloved wiggle worm, Adibi, crossed the rainbow bridge on Friday.  We had him in our lives for over 10 years, and trust me when I say that I wanted 10 more....then 10 more...then 10 more after that.  He fit the boxer mold to a T: high energy, high love, high amount of kisses and snuggles, big goofy boy.  
  
  
He had been diagnosed with cancer earlier last year and has been fighting it ever since.  He spent the last year on Chemo trying to fight it away, and his health really regressed downhill the last month or so.  He lost appetite, ability to control bodily fluids, and no amount of love and kisses and medicine was making him better.  The decision was tough, but we knew he'd be done with the pain he was dealing with every day.  
  
  
I sat down and explained to my 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter what was happening and the decision we had made.  My daughter didn't quite grasp it, but my son did.  He sat with me, with tears welling up in his eyes as I told him Adibi is going to the doggy hospital and they are going to help him get to doggy heaven (I used specific terms as to not associate hospitals with death).  He took it in for a few minutes, and I asked him ""Do you understand what's happening?"" He said ""yes"", and I followed up ""Adibi and I are going, but Adibi won't be coming back"".  And then with tears in his eyes, and his voice cracking he said ""But I want him to come back"".  I lost it friends.... I never cried so hard in my life.
  
  

And so Adibi and I spent our last day together doing what he loves.  He loved walks, but couldn't get out much because of the pain.  But that day, he found the energy to come with me to pick our son up from the bus stop.  He got unlimited snuggles and kisses, and a chance to say goodbye to everyone.  He went one one last car ride (his favorite) with a stop at McD's for his last meal.  He chose a double quarter pounder with cheese and french fries (good boy!).  My boy was put to sleep in my arms while I cried a million tears.  He's now playing with Copper (our other boxer who died a couple of years ago) as though they were puppies again.  I will miss him....every day.  It will get easier, and it helps to know I got one last day to spoil him rotten.  RIP Buddy, you always were and always will be ....a  good boye.

7viomo,1517870435,nvda,Why this correction is wonderful in the long run!,"1. After the long bull run, this is an excellent time to realize profits, since it is the beginning of the year this is also optimal from a tax perspective

2. Valuations have been getting out of hand. Personally I feel a lot more comfortable buying in at a PE ratio of 15 vs 25, all other things being equal. There are a lot of great companies out there (AMZN, NVDA) but as a disciplined investor I can't justify buying in at current prices (one missed quarter of earnings and I could be in for a 20-30% haircut vs maybe a 5-10% upside, there is little margin of safety)

3. Volatility is good (or at least a lot more interesting), I'd rather experience a few down days and set myself up for the next bull run compared to buying in at ATH and seeing the market trade sideways for a few months. Also a great opportunity for shorting some companies that may have been propped up by the bull market but trade at unrealistic valuations.

7virxc,1517871210,aapl,Super Dumb Question: what actually *is* a non-voting share of a very large public company that will never pay dividends or be purchased by another company?,"(Throwaway account because I'm embarrassed to ask this and will probably make a large number of incorrect statements that reveal my total ignorance in the following. Please feel free to correct all of them! Having said that, I'll refrain from putting ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but..."" before every sentence below -- just pretend it's there though.)

For example, a lot of big tech companies like GOOG and AMZN likely fall under this category. (Notably not AAPL since they do pay dividends.)

The obvious reason to buy stock in such a company is if you expect its price to go up, so that you can make money by selling it at the higher price later on.

And I get that -- it makes perfect sense that person 1 owns it because s/he thinks person 2 will value it higher later, who thinks that person 3 will value it even higher later, etc... But at some point down the line, for all of that to make sense, doesn't there have to be a person N who buys the stock expecting to directly profit from the company's profits and/or its increased value (as in the context of an acquisition, for the latter)?

It's very obvious to me what the ""real"" value of equity is in a startup that's likely to IPO or be acquired later.  It's also obvious what the value of equity is in established companies that regularly pay investors a percentage of profits in the form of dividends.  But the question of what the ""real"" value of equity in companies that fit the title is has been bugging the shit out of me!

I can think of 3 categories of answers to this question:

* There are one or more (probably obvious) reasons to own such a stock that I completely missed.
* There aren't any other reasons to own such a stock, but there actually aren't any companies in existence that fit the thread title -- in fact there is an expectation that even companies like GOOG and AMZN will *eventually* pay dividends and/or be acquired at some point down the line.
* There actually are no other reasons to own such a stock -- nobody expects companies like GOOG or AMZN to ever pay dividends or be acquired, and buying such a stock really is just a bet that the price will be higher later and nothing else.  (In which case I won't be able to get past feeling like this is some sort of paradox and philosophical black hole for my brain...)

Which is it and why?! (Or is it something else entirely? Or am I not making any sense at all?)",1

Guidelines say not to post a lot of code, so I'll leave the link below. I've left comments in the code with everything I'd like to accomplish with the project, as well as the issues I'm having and solutions I've tried.

https://gitlab.com/ltcalvery/stock_parser_test.git

Tl;dr- I need to parse a bunch of text and generate a .csv, but occasional formatting errors and overlapping text issues are preventing me from getting it perfect.

The long version- 

At my job, a daily report is typed up that details which traders bought and sold which stocks/assets, and I think that the reports can be used to generate some interesting data for trends analysis. These reports are emailed out at the end of the day. I dunno how to get a python script to read my Outlook email, but I'm willing to save it to a .txt file manually. What I'd like the code to do is read a .txt file, and convert it either into a .csv or other easily Excel-able format, like '/' delimited. The text will always follow the same format, but there are occasionally typos and quirks as people add in entries at the end of the day. There's not much I can do about the typos, but I would at least like to get this script up to the point where I can use it to parse a properly formatted string, generate a .csv, plug that into Excel using pandas, and generate some charts about who trades what, which activities occur the most, trends in sales, etc.

Here's an example of the report contents:

00001/4 JAN/MARK/BOUGHT (BGT) 500 SHARES (SHR) OF APPLE TECHNOLOGY (AAPL) 
AT $160/SHR

Ideally, it'll get split into four sections: TRADER/COMP1/COMP2/ACTY. I'd want this entry to come out looking like MARK/Apple Technology/-/BGT

There are two main problems, stemming from the ACTY section of the parsed text (the labels and whatnot are further explained in the gitlab page, so you can look there for more clarification). First, if there are two companies mentioned, like in a trade, then both them will appear in the printed summary. That's how I want it, as shown in the example above. The question is, how do I get a second empty column occupied by '-' or something in the entries that only have one company? Having some entries with 3 columns and some with 4 columns makes creation of a .csv file pretty much impossible. Ideally, every entry will generate a set of data like TRADER/COMP1/COMP2/ACTY, and not just TRADER/COMP1/ACTY.

Second issue is what happens when an activity code is found inside another word in the ACTY section. The activity codes are three letter acronyms like BGT or BAS. If a code like BAS shows up in the activity section in a word basic, it'll add a section to the output labeled BAS, even if BAS wasn't the activity code used. I tried to use some regex magic to make it work, but I'm too much of a rookie to pull that off. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Ideally I'd like this done by Friday so that I can show it off at the weekly brainstorming session, but it's not super critical. 

Thanks in advance for the help!

7vmzc6,1517919885,msft,"I'm emotionally not attached to my money, is that a bad thing?","Hello there,

First some insight before the real question:

Noob here, I started to invest like 2 weeks ago. poured like 30k Euro into AMZN, NFLX, MSFT, SIE, ADS, DHER and GOOG. 
Also, every month 400 Euro go into 2 different ETFs.
It was fun first, seeing especially AMZN and NFLX go up and creating green numbers.
 
I know, I'm late to the party, but now, since everything is dropping, I just realize that I don't care about the money I am losing by the minute... It is like 2/3 of my savings, which previously just sat in my bank and did nothing. Also, I have no use for the money, I live in a nice flat I can effort, have a stable job and can save easily 400 - 500 Euro per month.

**Now to the main question:**

Please don't tell me on how stupid it was to invest in such stocks and so on, my main question is: Are you in a way emotionally attached to the money you invest? Like, do you check the stocks every day and feel tingling when they go up and down? Should I care more about the stuff which is going on? For me, those are really just numbers, I have not really a sense of value behind the money I had put in. Is it ""bad"" to feel that way?

Anyways I wanted some hindsight in regards to PM's. Does anyone trade them, if so what metals do you usually trade? 

I currently have a long position at 16.9$ on Silver because I believe that the depreciation of the USD will continue however I'm still somewhat hesitant due to the ongoing daily manipulation which they endure. Been trading them for 5/6 months and 9 times out of 10 they tank as soon as Wall Street opens, doesn't matter how the USDX is performing or how the stocks are doing. This isn't some tin foil conspiracy theory and it has been proven several times.

* U.S. Dow futures this morning were indicating another nosedive at the open that breach the correction level, defined as a decline of 10 percent over time from recent new highs. Monday was the worst day for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since August 2011 as well as the biggest single-day point drop for the Dow in history. Futures have been volatile all night and have been positive at various junctures. (CNBC)
* Why the stock market plunged Monday (CNBC)
* White House says it's 'concerned' about stock market drop (CNBC)
* Cramer: Stop yourself from panicking and find the sell-off's opportunities (CNBC)
* The yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note and on the 30-year Treasury bond were lower today as investors continued to keep abreast of the volatile trading seen across international and domestic markets. Bond yields move inversely to prices. (CNBC)
* The Cboe Volatility index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, was higher this morning after doubling during regular market hours Monday. The key market measure jumped above 50, its highest level since August 2015. (CNBC)
* Obscure security linked to stock volatility plummets 80% after hours, sparking worries of bigger market effect (CNBC)
* European stocks reduced some of their earlier losses after tumbling 3 percent in the early hours of today's session amid inflation growth expectations. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.7 percent lower with every sector in the red. (CNBC)
* Economic numbers will get no attention today, but there are a few on the schedule beginning with the December trade deficit at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Labor Department releases its December JOLTS report at 10 a.m., its measure of job opportunities and labor turnover. (CNBC)

* Bitcoin fell below $6,000 to its lowest level in more than two months, according to CoinDesk. The move came amid worries of increased regulation. With the decline, it has now lost more than 50 percent for the year so far. (CNBC)
* Over $550 billion wiped off cryptocurrencies since record high (CNBC)
* House GOP lawmakers are proposing a long-term boost to military funding in a short-term spending bill slated for a vote this week. The move is likely to cause tension with some Democrats and complicate plans to keep the government open. (Washington Post)
* President Donald Trump's lawyers have reportedly cautioned him not to take wide-ranging questions from Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. Trump has publicly said he wants to interview with Mueller. (NY Times)
* A House panel has voted to release the Democratic rebuttal to the GOP's accusation that the FBI misled a secret surveillance court. President Trump will have a work week's time to decide to release the information publicly. (Washington Post)
* Carter Page on Nunes memo: 'Worse than I could have possibly imagined' (Politico)
* 'Treasonous': Trump goes after Dems who didn't clap during State of the Union (CNBC)

7vo6jo,1517932028,aapl,"If you believe this is the beginning of a bear market, history of the market is VERY relevant.","DISCLAIMER: I first invested in 2013 and I'm long-term bullish crypto.

I'm not calling things one way or another here. Nobody can predict what will happen. Here is what I do know based on basic observations of markets historically.

1. A bear market is always a possibility. Anybody who tells you otherwise is delusional, malicious, or uninformed. 

2. The crypto market itself has seen bear markets. Specifically the period from Jan 2014 - Oct 2015 (roughly 2 years), was a crypto bear market where the price went on  a downtrend and then just moved sideways for a months on end. A quick look at coinmarketcap will corroborate this fact.

Again, not trying to make a call here, but assuming we are headed for a bear market, I think everybody should be aware of the potential purge of the shitcoins. It has been discussed at length, but I think a visual is helpful.

**This is CMC on NOV 2013 -- Right before the last bear market**
http://web.archive.org/web/20131130052825/http://coinmarketcap.com/

A few observations:

1. BTC is close to its ATH.

2. Even with BTC at number 1 and climbing fast, look at the rest of the top coins. Mostly MASSIVE gains. I'm talking 30 - 150% + gains. Absolutely crazy. 

3. Only 37 coins total.

**Here is CMC on Feb 2014 right after the 'pop'. (Not at the bottom)**
http://web.archive.org/web/20140208025750/http://coinmarketcap.com/

Things to note:

1. BTC down about 40% from its all time high.

2. Most of the other coins down 60+%

3. Coins with use cases and very optimistic communities (namecoin, peercoin) faring much better than ""shitcoins"" but still pummeled pretty badly.

4. 93 coins! The amount of coins almost tripled in that period. NOTE: it would be too hard to research which of these already existed and just weren't listed on CMC. The point I'm making is that this was the first real wave of shitcoins in the crypto world. Hundreds of people just looking to make a quick buck by premining and cashing in on the trend.


**Last one, here is CMC today:**
https://coinmarketcap.com/

Things to note:

1. Can anybody spot which of the 93 coins made their way to 2018 top 100? I found 7, but I'm sure I missed a couple that somebody else can point out.

2. Even the ones that made it through all these years are worth around the same, or LESS than they were at their 2013 highs. My theory is that the coins have fallen out of favor in terms of market sentiment, being supplanted by a new round of 'hype' coins.


CONCLUSION:

Most of the shit that got hyped during this latest bull run will likely go to zero, or just fade into obscurity, never to reach their ATHs ever again. History tells the same story over and over, and the examples above show it clearly. 

If you believe there is some gas left in the bull tank, then you can dismiss this outright.

If, however, you believe that we could be headed for a bear market, then it makes sense to take cover in what you consider to be safe bets. 

No, just because something has a use case DOES NOT make it safe. We just saw the decimation of coins from 2014 that in theory had 'use cases'. It does not matter, since only a few players will survive and by the time the next bull market comes around the landscape will be completely different.

For a similar case study on this, just look at the 2001 dotcom bubble where a huge number of companies went bankrupt, and the remainder have yet to get back to those all-time-highs, with only a couple of exceptions (AMZN, AAPL, GOOG). The tech scene today has pretty much no memory of those failed dotcoms and a big percentage is made up of new players.

7vvu3t,1518007517,aapl,"Egoism is often cited for the decline of social norms, though the reality is quite the opposite. (Corporate culture collectivism)","
True egoism would actually mean being concentrated and satisfied on **only** oneself, without feeling the need to decide over others or let others decide over oneself. It implies a mutual respect and not apathy as we perceive it through society.

This isn't the case today, since we have instead is a false egoism created through deliberate manipulation.

I call this corporate cultural collectivism.

I will explain through an example: The iPhone from Apple Inc.

Imagine seeing an advertisement for the iPhone. The ""**i**"" in the product name implies suitability of a **personalized** consumer experience for the **single** individual, but nothing could be further from the truth since this is a **standardized** and **mass**-produced device.

Then you are likely familiar with the masses of consumers lining up on launch day of such a product in front of an Apple store...does this remind anyone of the bread-lines or rationing in the Soviet Union already ? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing_in_the_Soviet_Union)

Now i imagine a sales pitch between a true egoist and an Apple Inc. businessman:

The egoist is offered this corporate product, this corporate branded medium, what would he say:

""**You** trying to sell **me** something, something with **your corporations name** on it ? No, **i** don't care about **your** product, **i** don't need it. It's not for me, it does not have **my** name, **my** personality in it.""

See what i just described ? The **true** egoist would decline having this piece of corporate culture imposed on himself. 

This is a foreign brand, the ""i"" in ""iPhone"" is about Apple, not you.

If you purchase this piece of materialized propaganda, you submit yourself to THEIR brand, THEIR culture, THEIR ideology.

This is **communism** sold to you as **individualism**. Whoever came up with this is a evil genius.

It's what this false egoism is all about. I have no specific bias against Apple Inc., i just see it as one of the worst offenders.

This can be applied to any other large corporate brand product as well.

I don't see a specific problem with the actual product, but rather the ideological aspect behind it. It's extremely subtle, but it works as you can easily prove by looking at how well AAPL Inc. stocks have risen over the last decades.

To put it in relation to this posts title: We don't have actually declining norms of social decency, but rather a subtle exchange/replacement of old values against new collectivist values, where the individual counts as nothing / is worthless on it's own. 

Mass corporate culture, Trump culture, Left-wing culture are byproducts of this mental cancer today.

7vxoq8,1518024124,mcd,I think we should be happy to have had Joshy McD in Denver!,"Think about it. McD did come in and totally fuck up the team, but it also directly/indirectly led to the following to happen:
 
1. John Elway becoming GM to right the ship
2. 4-12 season leading to drafting of Von!
3. One draft gem in DT
4. Having Tebow (drafted by McD) play so terribly under Center in Elway’s first year, which required a new QB...
5. Peyton Fucking Manning signing as a result of the wave of events below
6.  5 AFC West chips, two AFC chips, two SB appearances, SB 50 champs. 

So in essence, McDs horrific tenure set in motion the glorious Peyton era of Broncos history. 

So, thanks? 

Edit: I would like it to be known that I too think Josh McDaniels is a douche bag who fucked up my beloved Broncos and I am by no means saying we should like or support him. But upon reflection, I do feel that he was a catalyst in the coming of the incredible Peyton Manning era, that most likely would not have transpired had we kept Cutler.",0

Looking to pay off my 30K in student loans in 2-3 years and begin saving for a house. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! ",0
7vyty3,1518032920,tsla,Tesla (TSLA) fourth quarter 2017 results and conference call - Official Thread,"Tesla (TSLA) is set to release its fourth quarter 2017 financial results today, February 7 after market close. As usual, the release of the results will be followed by a conference call and Q&amp;A with Tesla’s management at 2:30pm Pacific Time (5:30pm Eastern Time).

I will add the shareholders letter here as soon as it becomes available, which should be a few minutes after market close.

Please keep the posts related to the earnings in this thread

____________
**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla’s deliveries drive most of its earning results since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

Tesla already confirmed its fourth quarter 2017 deliveries: 29,870 vehicles – a new record for the company.

They ended up delivering 15,200 Model S vehicles, 13,120 Model X vehicles, and 1,550 Model 3 vehicles.

Those numbers are adjusted slightly during the earnings.

Additionally, 2,520 Model S and X vehicles and 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter, according to the company.

Here are Tesla quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches: https://i.imgur.com/Y6PdSQt.jpeg

**Revenue**

Wall Street’s revenue consensus is $3.299 billion for the quarter and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts almost the same result: $3.302 billion in revenue.

It would be a record quarter for revenue if those estimates are accurate.

The record delivery numbers for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 resulted in this increase on the results quarter-to-quarter from Tesla’s actual revenue of $2.985 billion during the last quarter, which was also a record.

**Earnings**

Earnings per share, or rather loss per share, is expected to plunge again for the quarter.

Like for revenue, the expectations are again close for both the street and retail investors. The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $3.19 per share for the quarter, while Estimize’s prediction is a loss $3.11 per share.

7vz3n8,1518035013,nflx,NFLX's potential longterm?,"I haven't seen netflix mentioned on here too often despite it being a fairly popular stock, so I was curious what people thought of it. The bits and pieces I've heard seem to feel that Netflix is overvalued, but I want to know why people think that way. I've had a share of netflix since the summer and recently bought another one before the dip (rip) at 269, but it seems to have already bounced back. Do you all think Netflix still has a lot of room for growth, or is that already accounted for? Netflix seems to be getting a stronger grounding on the legal anime streaming community. Thoughts on that and how well they'll monetize it? How do you think the subscribers would respond to another price increase in a year or so (or is that too far out there to predict)?  
To give some context, I'm still learning the ropes (just practicing right now). I'm started investing at the end of this past summer with $1000 and I'm currently up 12-15%. Currently spread across NFLX (2), AET, CSCO, V, and WM (2). Previously had 2 TSLA but sold them off before the dip in favor of and additional NFLX and everything else I have on the list.",0

It's not too late. Just keep it on the DL and don't turn it into a meme

Also, TSLA posts a slightly smaller loss than anticipated (still a huge loss), stock goes up. Apple makes more money than God, increases smart phone market share, revenue, etc, and it plummets.

7w4ep9,1518092534,gme,Can anybody tell me what am I doing wrong?,"Last season I was Silver V, and now I got placed  Bronze 3. I played a few games and got to 64 LP. But now I'm sitting at zero. Here are some game recaps from past few days:  
  
Game 1: I decide to play Janna. I set up a few kills to my Ashe, ward the river and their jungle,  am 0/0/2 now. Top is feeding, mid is even, we are even because our jungler and Ashe are feeding their Vayne. I am Janna, but not a saint and can't save them from certain death regardless of spamming heals and E's. And as support I am extremely squishy, so I finish 1/9/4.  
  
Game 2: I pick Annie, their mid picks Zoe. I do fine (1/2/1) in lane and farm really well (always had two waves more in my CS than her) and ward a shitton. However, everybody else in my team is feeding and flaming each other. You can guess the result.  
  
Game 3: I play Xayah, my main who I rarely play in Solo q because she is mechanically hard and I want to secure wins. So I get in lane where I am 7/2 and my Poppy support (?) dies to their Cait 6 times. Their Lee destroys our top and mid and jg who refuse to buy wards when I tell them to so I have to ward our jungle, their jungle and the river but they still don't look at the map. Now I have like 20 LP.  
  
Game 4: I play Janna again, but my ADC goes AFK after 15 minutes so we surrender. 3LP.
  
  
Game 5: I pick Kassadin against a Fizz otp (I was the first pick). I do OK, taking the first blood and going 2/1. I roam once but don't do much-they saw me and ran away. But then our Blitz leaves bot, comes mid, steals 80 of my minions (I finished with 60, my historical low in cs) and gives Fizz 12 kills. Then he goes and roams and does solo drags and I am left crying.  When I ask Blitz why he says, I'm quoting ""YOU BASTARD KASDIN DONT SAY SS WE FUKING LOSE GME YOU FKING IDIOT"" so I reported him after the game. 
  
  
And now I'm sitting at 0 LP and thinking about what am I doing wrong. I ward, I look at the map, farm well, have a good KDA, roam, never flame, always say things like gj or wp when somebody takes kill, ping, position well, have huge game knowledge and play easy champions. How to improve and what to do to climb?

7w4h4d,1518093341,aapl,coloured coins,"just heard about a bitcoin idea known as coloured coins

with this, you take some tiny amount of btc, and use it to represent an asset of some kind

nano could do this better because fees are zero. 

say you have a company and issue shares. you are APPLE. you want to isssue a million shares, so you get a million satoshi, and you permanently tag these as representing one share of AAPL. they become coloured coins, and different to a normal satoshi, but they are still traded on bitcoin blockchain

these satoshi will be valued much higher because they are tagged as representing a company share

it breaks down in bitcoin because fees could be higher than the actual holding, but in nano, no such problem

this would be a long way into the future but i wondered what you think?

Imo it is a beast. I honestly think it is super undervalued. Low P/E and solid earnings. How is it that companies like SNAP and NFLX are so overvauled where their potential relative to BA is minor.

I think that AeroSpace is everything and by definition has infinite growth. Commercial? Defense? The Boeing has it all.
On top of that they pay a fat divident.

I am honestly looking for some critique and your opinion on the company guys. Happy trading!",0

7w6gak,1518110879,tsla,Earnest questions For Model 3 Waitlisters from a TSLA shorter,"I took a small short position in Tesla before earnings announcement. I think the company is pretty neat, but overvalued. While doing my research I came here, also followed the vin bot, some other things. What follows are some basic observational questions I'd like some earnest answers to. Please don't consider this a troll.
 
Why are you waiting for more than 3 (perhaps 4 or 5) years for a $37k car that competes with a ""buy it today"" electric car from GM that goes for $35k before incentives?
What's the draw?
Is it sunk cost fallacy?
Is it fanatical belief?
Are you hoping the car will be better when you get it?
Why do you want an electric car when you can get an equivalent low cost gas powered car for half the cost?
Does GM's electric car not offer what you want?
Are you concerned about Tesla not delivering quality workmanship?

EDIT:
Let me try to rephrase the Bolt specific questions a different way:
How much longer are you willing to wait for your model 3 rather than buy another car (gas or electric)?
How much more would the model 3 have to be (or the bolt less) for you to seriously consider switching?


EDIT 2:
I gave a somewhat detailed explanation of my position, even thought that was not the intent of the thread:

It's not as much as I bet you would think :). I do think Tesla makes some great products, I simply doubt the current valuation of the company.",0

7w7aep,1518117286,mcd,Regret.,"In light of all of this McDaniels/Patriots madness I thought of something.

I know a player.  A true NFL talent, born for the game.  

This guy (born May 14, 1983) is an American football running back of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Miami, and was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft, playing with them from 2005 to 2014. He is the 49ers all-time leader in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.

This player has often been ranked among the best and most respected running backs playing the game, having had nine 1,000 rushing yard seasons and five Pro Bowl selections.

While achieving some personal success, he struggled with a team that suffered numerous losing seasons.  In 2012, he made the Super Bowl XLVII, but never got his ring.  He became the 49ers career rushing yards leader and in 2012, he became the 49ers rushing touchdowns leader. In 2014, he became the 29th player to have rushed for over 10,000 yards. He is one of only three players to have nine consecutive seasons with 200 or more carries, while also maintaining an average of four yards per carry or better. The other two players to accomplish this are Hall of Famers Jim Brown and Barry Sanders.

This man made a choice, and a hard one.  He was leaving his team.  Leaving the sun, leaving the fans that loved him, leaving the place where he had built a HOF legacy for one reason and one reason only.  He wanted a championship. 

He left everything he had in the bag, for one last shot that so many other players miss... to get that trophy.

He verbally committed to a team, the Eagles... the plans were set, he was ready to go. 

This man was Frank Gore.  

Before it was all said and done. Gore was talking to his old buddy at Miami, and it was not to vent about his current situation. In fact, Gore had nearly made the move to Philadelphia to join head coach Chip Kelly. Kelly's other offseason moves, however -- which included the departures of running back LeSean McCoy, wide receiver Jeremy Maclin and quarterback Nick Foles -- made Gore uneasy.

""The next day he called back again, 'what's up, man? Like, you hear anything?'"" Johnson recalls with a laugh. ""So, the third time, we talked. I asked him, 'Be honest, what team you think can win a Super Bowl right now?' He said, 'I like the Colts.' So, in my mind when he said that I was like, that's my team.""

He ended up signing with the Colts, what he thought was a better team, poised to win, with a buddy who could help make it happen.

He left the Eagles, his first choice, left them just like McD did to us.  Eagles were completely blindsided, if I remember and none to happy about the news.  Now they are the superbowl champions.  He went through all of that... and had the team he needed to get his ring, last minute took a left... and now he has to look up at himself getting ready for this next season and I bet it hurts.

Talk about regret.

So now that the same thing has happened to us, lets get this man a ring! Shove it right in McDouchbag's dumb face while Bill Belicheat and the Deflatriots are all still there.  Let's make him regret it.  I want my revenge and your god damn right the rivalry is back on.

7w867z,1518124227,mcd,Internal free agency,"Alright guys, we all know how badly McD screwed us over.  And now we're all trying to figure out who the next coach is going to be. But, on the plus side, we have Eberflus under contract now. I'm *really* excited to see the defense he puts together, especially as a LB wizard. Sounds like he was going to be someone teams wanted to take a look at anyway. But there are still 53 guys who need to be brought together to be put on the field for the coach. Let's take a look at who the Colts have right now, shall we? This will include those on IR. I'll talk about futures at the end.

QB: Andrew Luck, Jacoby Brissett

I don't think there's really any debate over this one. Roll with what we have, maybe look for a third string among camp bodies. Can't be worse than Tolzein.

WR: TY Hilton, Chester Rogers, KJ Brent, Krishawn Hogan

We're going to need 2 or 3 receivers for the final 53.

TE: Jack Doyle, Erik Swoope, Darrell Daniels, Travis Ross, Jason Vander Laan

That's 5 TEs. Some of those were because of IR moves, but we're definitely not keeping them all for the final 53.

RB: Josh Ferguson, Marlon Mack, Robert Turbin, Matt Jones, George Winn, Christine Michael

We have a committee. Turbo for 3rd and short, Mack for change of pace. We need that front-man, run blocking, fast back. We've got some depth set, but we might bring up some competition.

OL: Denzelle Good (T/G), Joe Haeg (T/G), Ryan Kelly (C), Deyshawn Bond (G), Anthony Castanzo (T), Anthony Fabiano (C), Jeremy Vujnovich (G), Mark Glonkowski (G), Le'Raven Clark (T), Tyreek Burwell (T)

3 G, 3 C, 3 T, 2 multi-purpose. As far as numbers go, we're not doing too bad. As far as quality goes, we have some need.

DT: Jonathan Hankins, Caraun Reid, Hassan Ridgeway, Grover Stewart, Henry Anderson, Al Woods, Joey Mbu

We're *probably* switching to a 4-3. Good to have DTs, we might want another one or two. But between Hankins, Ridgeway, Stewart, and Anderson, we're doing well for starters.

DE: Margus Hunt, Anthony Johnson, Jabaal Sheard, Tarell Basham

With the switch to 4-3, our OLBs will need to make a transition, so I added them here. But with 4-3, DE becomes much more important. We could definitely use more bodies, and we will *need* an upgrade of some sort.

LB: Jeremiah George, Antonio Morrison, Anthony Walker Jr., Jermaine Grace, John Simon. R.I.P., Poundcake.

I'm including Simon here because I see him getting moved to LB instead of DE. We... Need lots and lots of help at this position. Lots and lots.

CB: Nate Hairston, Quincy Wilson, Chris Milton, Kenny Moore II, DJ White

We need more CBs. Hopefully another high-level back, to set up out there with Wilson and Hairston. We'll live, but we could use help.

S: Malik Hooker, Clayton Geathers, Matthias Farley, TJ Green

We have 3 fantastic quality safeties and TJ Green. The drop-off is real. We also have zero depth, so that may be a problem.

Special Teams: Rigoberto Sanches (P), Luke Rhodes (LS)

Vinatieri is a free agent this year, so we're going to need to either re-sign him or find a new K.

So, looking at what we have right now:

* 2 QB
* 4 WR
* 5 TE
* 6 RB
* 4 OG
* 4 OT
* 3 C
* 7 DT
* 4 DE
* 5 LB
* 5 CB
* 4 S
* 1 P
* 1 LS
* 0 K

That gives us a total of 55 people on the active roster right now, not including free agents. We'll definitely be cutting some DTs, some RBs, some TEs, and probably a few of that OL depth. But let's figure out how many free agents we want to retain.

**NOT** retaining: Kamar Aiken (WR), Scott Tolzein (QB), Darius Butler (S)

**Probably NOT** retaining (will take a very cheap deal to keep): Donte Moncrief (WR), Frank Gore (RB)

**Probably** retaining (50-50 chance): John Bostic (LB), Jack Mewhort (OG), Brandon Williams (TE), Pierre Desir (CB), Rashaan Melvin (CB), Barkevious Mingo (OLB, probably as DE)

**Definitely** retaining (if we can): Adam Vinatieri (K), Michael Person (G)

Alright, so let's take a little peek at the situation we're looking at here. We'll assume 50-50 and up we're keeping, so we need to find room for 8 free agent re-signs. So we've got 63 people and need to trim 10 off.

Switching to a 4-3, we'll say we get rid of 2 DTs, 1 DE, 1 T, 1 G, 2 TE, 3 RB. Who will those be?

We'll cut: Joey Mbu and Caruan Reid for DTs, Anthony Johnson as DE, Tyreek Burwell at T, Mark Glowinski at G, Ross Travis and Jason Vander Laan at TE, George Winn, Matt Jones, and Christine Michael at RB to make space for them.

That gives us:

* 2 QB
* 4 WR
* 4 TE
* 3 RB
* 4 OG
* 3 OT
* 3 C
* 5 DT
* 4 DE
* 6 LB
* 7 CB
* 4 S
* 1 P
* 1 LS
* 1 K

I know that we have a lot of free agents that people want to pick up this offseason, but we also need to think about who we're getting rid of to make space for them. Including the people we have on Reserve/Futures, we already have 77 of the 90 camp bodies. Add in 7 draft picks, and we get room for 6 UDFAs or other free agents. So when you're thinking about who to pick up in free agency, remember who we'll be getting rid of. We have room to get rid of 2 or 3 CBs, 2 LBs, 1 TE, 1 OG, 2 DT. Gives us room to pick up, at most, 9 new people in addition.

**TL;DR:** Given what we're looking at in free agency, our reserves/futures, and the draft, we have space to pick up 6 UDFAs for the 90 camp bodies. We also have personnel numbers to spare for 9 cuts for bigger free agent signings.",1

7wanmq,1518146868,mcd,"Aurinia Pharmaceuticals: Breaking Down the Value of the Pipeline, and What Shares are Worth Today","**Company Background**

Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biotech firm in pursuit of developing voclosporin for use in LN. The company has a current market capitalization of ~$450 million, with $170 million in cash. That cash is enough to fund the company all the way through to the projected commercialization of voclosporin in 2020, and thus dilution is not a concern. Their phase II clinical trial in LN was the first of its kind to reach both primary and secondary endpoints with statistical significance. To put it short this drug is the real deal, and they're addressing a market that has no approved treatments, with management willing to suggest that voclosporin could reach $1.4 billion in peak annual sales. To put this in reference, biotech firms are typically bought out at a multiple of 1.5-3x ""peak"" earnings (Juno Therapeutics was acquired by Celgene for 3x *projected* peak sales, despite having no approved products). 

As a standard disclaimer, I own AUPH stock and it is my largest personal position. 


##**The Pipeline**

In October, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals (AUPH) held an ""R&amp;D Day"" in which the company announced its intent to develop Voclosporin in Nephrotic Syndrome, more specifically minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). These two indications make up approximately 45% of all Nephrotic Syndrome diagnosis and, like Lupus Nephritis, carry a large unmet medical need. Additionally, it was announced that their voclosporin ophthalmic solution (VOS) would be tested in dry eye syndrome patients. Upon announcing these indications, shares continued to slump as though no positive value was attributed to their expanded pipeline. Although its possible that the announcement of said indications had been priced into the shares, but the disparity between share price and the share's true value has alluded long term holders of this stock. 

In an effort to determine if shareholders should be placing any value on these expanded indications, I wanted to incorporate them into my model for Aurinia shares. Nephrotic Syndrome revenues will be calculated using patient population figures, market share projections, and economic burden of the disease to devise a per-share valuation in terms of cash flow. Placing a value on the dry eye indication is difficult, if not impossible. Management's claims that they have no intentions of becoming an ophthalmology company infers divestment of this asset. Terms of such a deal would be carefully negotiated between firms, and any projections made would be mere assumptions. Based on recent deals, a partnership could be worth between $20-40 million in up front cash, and $500 million+ in the case of long term success and commercialization. Although these figures will not be included in my model, here is the reference information used to draw these conclusions: 

- Shire agrees to purchase Parion's phase II dry eye drug, P-321, for $20 million in up-front cash with a potential for $535 million in milestone payments.

- Sun Pharma agrees to buy Ocular Therapeutics for $40 million with undisclosed milestone payments, a deal focused around a phase III cyclosporine asset for dry eye. 

- Allergan agrees to purchase tavilermide for use in dry eye for $50 million plus undisclosed milestone payments. 

- Nephrotic Syndrome 

**Minimal Change Disease**

Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndromes (NS). When the kidneys properly filter blood, proteins pass through but are not filtered by the kidney into the urine. In minimal change disease patients, proteins leak through the capillary wall into the urine, causing proteinuria (disease is classified by &gt;3g proteinuria daily). 

[Diagram of how MCD effects the kidney](http://unckidneycenter.org/images/kidney-health-library-pictures/minimal-change-disease-foot-processes)

There are currently no approved therapies for minimal change disease. Most cases are treated with corticosteroids or prednisone, although success rates vary greatly due to age and history of prior illness. From the age range of 15-39 to the range of 40-78, remission rates fall from 70% to just 30%. Voclosporin has the potential to meet the unmet need in older patients of controlling levels of proteinuria and providing a greater chance of remission.  

**Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis**

FSGS is also among the most common and serious causes of nephrotic syndrome, and can lead to ""end-stage renal disease"" ((ESRD)). In FSGS, glomeruli, responsible for the filtration of blood, become permanently scarred. Controlling proteinuria levels are key to treating FSGS, as deterioration can materialize in renal failure within just weeks to a year of the development of symptoms. 

The treatment landscape is largely unsuccessful in controlling proteinuria, and can be a complicated maze for healthcare providers to navigate. FSGS is  most commonly treated with corticosteroids, or a calcineurin inhibitor, like cyclosporin A, with the goal to achieve partial remission. 

[Treatment algorithm for FSGS](http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/9/3/626/F2.large.jpg)

Issues with this treatment pathway include steroid resistance rates of 50%, and CNI relapse rates of 50%. Experimental treatments using mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) show response rates of 15-20% which is clinically meaningful but means that patients lack a reliable way to avoid ESRD. The control of proteinuria levels in patients is the single best way to preserve function of the kidney to induce remission.

**Voclosporin's Clinical Benefit**

The primary method to induce remission in either of these indications includes the controlling of proteinuria levels. Most patients are diagnosed with levels of &gt;3g proteinuria per day, and Aurinia will be testing to see if Voclosporin can induce complete remission (&gt;0.3g proteinuria), or a partial remission (50% reduction in urinary protein to creatine ratio (UPCR)). This treatment pathways rids the need for corticosteroids, which induce undesired side effects in patients. Based on data from Aurinia's LN trial, voclosporin is a superior CNI to cyclosporin A in this regard.

Voclosporin has been shown, with statistical significance, to reduce and control proteinuria levels in LN patients. Additional benefits include greater potency when compared to cyclosporin A, leading to an improved safety profile from the lower dose requirement. If Voclosporin can simply repeat these results in NS patients, they stand to become the first approved treatment in this field.  Voclosporin will still have to compete with the likes of cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, it's less expensive CNI counterparts, but its advantages will not be overlooked. End stage renal disease can lead to an expensive and hard to access transplant, or dialysis treatment. 

##**Sales Projections**

I'll be using the same pricing model as I did in my LN model, with the table shown below. This data is based on current economic burdens of treating LN (~$68,000 annually), and management estimates of pricing in the range of $50-100k annually. Due to overreaching European policies in regulating drug prices, I've modeled for a 55% discount to prices in the EU. 



. | Price (US | Price (EU)
-|---------|----------
**Average Sale Price** | ***$54,750*** | ***$24,638***
**Retail Price** | $69,000 | $31,050
**Average Wholesale Price** | $75,000 | $33,750


What is this added indication worth in terms of sales? Nephrotic Syndrome effects about 50 out of every 1,000,000 US citizens every year, yielding annual incidence of 16,155. Out of these patients, it is estimated that MCD accounts for 15% of these cases, or 2,423 patients annually. The more common FSGS is estimated to have between 5,400 - 9,500 (based on Aurinia's R&amp;D day figures) new patients annually. Remaining conservative, I'll be modeling for 6,500 new FSGS patients. Therefore, the total new patient population every year that will be used is 8,923. Due to the unmet need, there is a current patient population of 60,000 patients that could be treated with voclosporin.

I will assume a market share of just 50%, despite this being the first approved treatment for these conditions (where typical market share figures are 60-70%), and a drug list price of $75,000 annually. I projected these cash flows through 2028 (when Aurinia will lose patent protection) using standard sales ramp and a prevalence/incidence model for patient populations. With these inputs, peak sales should reach $638 million, with a standard sales ramp. After discounting these cash flows back to 2018 with a 15% discount rate, and weighting for a 30% chance of success in these indications yields a current per-share value of $2.14 (*$226 million in market cap*). 
 
This doesn't seem overly impressive with the stock trading above $5/share, but this is only the value of the newly added indications. When applying these same metrics to my LN model, I've determined peak sales estimates more accurately fall in the range of $2.2 - 2.7 billion, significantly higher than management's projected $1.4b (which they have repeatedly referred to as conservative figures). However, even modeling for just $1.4b in peak LN sales, discounting cash flows back to 2018 with a 15% discount, and weighing for a 60% chance of success in their LN phase III trial, share are worth $10.34. Add that together, and you arrive a current price target of $12.48. Upon success in achieving approval in LN, shares are worth $22 in terms of cash flow. 

**Conclusion**

I'm aggressively buying stock at these levels, and I anticipate shares will exceed $10 by the end of 2018 as we approach their phase III data readout in LN. I have personally spoken with COO, Michael Martin, where I addressed my concerns regarding enrollment criteria, patent length, and their dry eye trial design. I have a high level of conviction in this investment, but this is not an investment for everyone. If Aurinia fails their phase III LN trial, fully expect to lose most, if not all, of your investment. Biotech is risky and subject to a high level of public scrutiny and government oversight, so keep these factors in mind before making an investment. When I suggest a $10 price target, it's not to say that share will reach $10 this year, that is simply what I have determined to be a fair value for the stock.

Good luck to all.

7wasc0,1518148264,mcd,Key Note of OmiseGO at Asia Digital Expo,"1. OmiseGO provides a next-generation value transfer service operating across currencies and asset types through an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange on public blockchain operating at high volum and low cost.

2. OmiseGO try to build network that anyone can exchange or trade any loyalty point, game item, airmile. Even cross connect digital wallet like wechat, alipay and true wallet.
Example, 100 Mcdonald token and exchange to game league of legends. Exchange rate can be 1 MCD = 10 LOL. 

3. In order to exchange thing like that we need high speed network that be able to handle micro transaction up to 1 million transaction per second to start so OmiseGO need to tackle scalability issue of blockchain.

4. OMG is not cryptocurrency. It is open public network. OMG token will be used as gas cost to run network and it is utility token.

5. OmiseGo will provide SDK to any business to use SDK to connect to OmiseGo network. Imagine in the future we can use only one wallet which capable to hold digital asset within it.

6. OmiseGO will fits in the market in those area;
* Global schemes like AMEX, Mastercard, VISA, JCB
* eWallet + Private Coin + Points like True money, Alipay, WeChat, Grab, Go-Jek
*Crypto Exchange &amp; Acceptance

7.  It is difficult and unsecure to covert fiat to crypto on exchage. With OmiseGo SDK, you will be able to do it directly on your wallet.

Q&amp;A
- OMG will not store token on network. OMG is rail to send data only.
- One source of future revenue is building micro service on top of OMG network like payment gateway and fees collecting from merchant that use OMG network.
- Network will be able to do p2p cross chain trading like BTC to ETH.
- Omise provided a $100,000 grant to the Ethereum Foundation's Devgrants program in 2015.
- Regulator of each country can put regulation on ewallet provider that use OmiseGO SDK.",1

Otherwise, however, they are in good position to add a significant addition to the bottom line just from interest income.

7wexy7,1518196612,mcd,My very blunt prediction of players I can see moving on w/ notes!,"I’m also running on 30hrs of no sleep so I may be delusional. I’m open to constructive criticism and discussion. Tell me what you’d change and why!

McD - Mid 1st &amp; a 2nd/prospect (I do think us as fans look at our captain through rose colored glasses. Realistically the hype was real on pre-captain McDonough but he did not pan out to be the stud 2way dman we all wanted and hoped for. I do think he’s a top 4 player and deserves the long minutes he gets but I can’t see the huge price on his head that everyone else is seeing.)

Nash - Low 1st and a conditional 2nd/3rd (He came to us in his prime and as a hero in Columbus but slowed up pretty fast in NY. Don’t forget he’s always MIA in the playoffs. He wasn’t really “the guy” everyone expected him to be but he’s still a smart veteran elite player that’s going to a contending team or he’s not going at all so there will most likely be some sort of condition but I honestly don’t think he’s worth more than a 1st.)

Grabner &amp; Pick(s) - Roster player &amp; better pick/prospect (I don’t think he’s worth a 1st. He’s definitely clicking on the rangers but his worth is only in his feet. He’s the guy you want on your pk and at the end of a winning game when the other team pulls their goalie. Think back to the Hags trade.)

Zucc - Low 1st and a 4th/5th/6th (This one is tough because it’s hard to gauge an undrafted player that’s only been on one team. There’s no doubt he’s a hard working elite guy. He makes the players around him look so good. He makes up for his size in his tenacity and is a shootout champ. Plus everyone knows he’s a fan favorite and a swell locker room guy. I think any team would love a Zucc but I don’t think anyone is going to chase him.)

Miller &amp; Pick(s) - Good roster winger &amp; maybe a pick (Miller still has potential and a high ceiling. I think teams see that. If the rangers want to free up center space for younger talent I can see him being moved for a solid winger.) 

Holden - 3rd + a low prospect MAYBE??? (Idk I’d rather not talk about Holden.)

Smith off-season - 2nd (I think he’s still worth something to a team that will need a Dman come off season. His home wasn’t NY but I think he can be a top 4 guy elsewhere. Disclaimer: His price can easily become 3rd. Depends on the team but I think the Rangers would accept it.)

Staal - Summer of the buyout pt.II?

The King - A video of me sticking my head into a live hornet’s nest and screaming at the top of my lungs (It will not happen. Please stop.)

Edit: Alright, alright! Their value is too low! When I was writing my picks I was trying to remain as unbiased as possible. I really didn’t want my admiration for these guys play a role into the picks I made for them. I’m glad to hear that you guys think they’re lowballed.",1

Sorry if this has already been answered.

Just a quick question regarding discount brokerages, specifically VB in my case. Is it possible to place after hours orders that will then be fulfilled once market opens without actually going through in after hours and therefore not getting fees for an after hours trade?

For example, can I place a day limit order to buy 10 AAPL shares Sunday night at a given price which goes into affect only once market opens? Or are all orders made after hours subject to after hours trading fees.

Bought 1 TWTR put, $30.00 strike, 30 days until expiration on 03/09/2018

Hedged the above puts with the following;

INTC- 1 call, $43.00 strike, 35 days until expiration on 03/16/2018

PYPL- 1 call, 75.00 strike, 35 days until expiration on 03/16/2018

MSFT- 1 call, $85.00 strike, 35 days until expiration on 03/16/2018 




Thought process- I think the market has more downside the next month or so, hence the SPY/TWTR puts But I also wouldn't be surprised if we bottom out and start to rally.

 So in the event that happens, I chose the three best stocks I feel could be leaders in a rally.. Hence the MSFT, INTC and PYPL calls to hedge against my SPY/TWTR puts",1

I bought a recently a Microsoft DT-904 Wireless Charger from Amazon (same as the DT-903, but only with MSFT Brand instead of Nokia).
My Phone needs 3 Hours for charging and in this time it gets really really hot.
In 20 minutes it charges around 10% battery. This is 30% in one hour.
I'm curious if people really think that this is a okay charging time, just because they are to lazy to put in a charger cable in the phone.

So: Are this values normal? Do you also use one wireless charger?

And it seems like Microsoft removed support for notifications for the DT-904. ",1

7wmz56,1518285450,nvda,Started a position in NVDA Friday,"I'm a little late to the game here as I've watched NVDA run for almost a year but that earnings report was very impressive.  The demand alone that I see from the crypto mining market will take NVDA to the next level.  I've read some speculations that NVDA may come out with a mining based line of video cards to ease market prices.  I think that is a really clever idea and I wouldn't be surprised if they went that route.

I've been an Nvidia fan since the early 2000's when I started building my own gaming rigs and they have always been high quality and last a very long time.  I'm happy to own a small slice.

How about you guys?",1

The initial problem was this div was loading a stock quote and it took forever, but I managed to figure that out by blocking:

But now, and this is just a obsessive compulsive annoyance, the animated loading gif still shows for about second before being hidden, and I can't figure out how to locate it!!

Even a link to the specific uBlock ""how to"" document that contains the secret would be incredibly helpful, but if someone experienced could be even more specific I would be eternally grateful!!!

EDIT:

Ok, if I hit escape while the page is loading, **this is what I see in the element picker**:

**How to manage uBlock Origin in Medium Mode:**

Initial configuration for Medium Mode:  
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode

**Configuring NOOP rules on individual sites:**  
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide
....but the documentation doesn't actually fully explain it.  

**More detail on the 3 columns (green, grey, red) within the Global and Local columns:**

I see 6 buttons: there are 3 (green, grey, red) in the left (global) column, and 3 in the right (local) column.  
Green rule allows requests, grey rule cancels dynamic rules but not static, red rule forbids requests. Light version of colour means there is no specific dynamic rule for the cell but its affected by another cell's rule.  
[For example:](https://i.imgur.com/ATTcPi2.jpg)  
1) Default looking UI with my set of static filters (*3rd-party filters* tab)  
2) I allowed everything (uBlock doesn't filter anything at all), and created noop rule (grey) for google-analytics. On reddit google-analytics is filtered by static lists rules only. On the other sites google-analytics and everuthing else is allowed.  
3) google-analytics is nooped (grey) from global rule column, so it is not filtered dynamically anywhere, but is filtered by static lists. Every other request is allowed.  
4) google-analytics works everywhere except reddit. On reddit it is completely blocked even if there is exception static rule in the lists.  
5) google-analytics doesn't work on any site at all.  
Coloured (green, yellow, red) icons to the left from domain names are just indicators (if red - all requests have been blocked, if yellow - some requests have been blocked, if green - all request have been allowed).

7wonsq,1518301041,nvda,Everybody is over reacting to this minor correction,"On january new years many stocks shot up for no apparent reason. That is when i planned on reentering the market but i was smart enough to wait because this was clearly a trap. Now the market is simply reversing the ammount that went up on the first week of january. If you look at charts such as alibaba,nvda, amd, jd and many other stocks you can plainly see this fact. You guys who are overreacting are caught up in the hype instead of the reality. Unless you are trading options this pullback isnt a huge deal. Sure many of you lost alot of money but many are making this out to seem that its going to be 2008 all over again. Sure the market can truly crash but we havent lost 2 years of value only a correction of 1 or 2 months worth of value, at most 4. The only reason we experienced the worst point loss in 10 years is because things went so high, if it was the worst percentage loss wed have something to worry about. Point losses are always going to reach all time highs as the market grows. ",1
7wozj4,1518304249,msft,Was Microsoft overvalued in the 90s?,"Whenever I explain to people why I have weedstocks, I always use the comparison to the people who bought Microsoft stock in the early 90s.

I was a preteen in the 90s so I don't remember the business side of Microsoft but I do remember how it was a household name and how everyone would see the name every time they turn on a computer. So I'm wondering if that publicity inflated and hyped up their SP the same way it's happening to weedstocks right now.

I can't find a free chart of MSFT's market cap so [this](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/MSFT/fundamental/market-cap) is my best resource.

Hopefully it's accurate. If so, it means MSFT closed 1999 a little over $604 billion. Their revenue in 1999 was $19.7 billion.

Now backtrack to 1995. Revenue for that year was about $6 billion but the closing market cap was just shy of $52 billion.

If my arithmetic is right, that means from the close of 1995 to the close of 1999, revenue increased by roughly 228% but market cap went up about 1061%.

7wqc5e,1518318515,nvda,"Lost $65000USD from gambling, still not graduated from university. Despair knows no bounds.","I'm a student in a professional program in Canada. 

I failed to secure a job when most students have, although my GPA is above average. I been too embarrassed to talk to my friends in the faculty and have been miserable for a while. 

In January 2017 I made $1000 from Nvda stock. I felt invincible. I took out $30000CAD from a line of credit and lost $20000 when I made  risky calls. I vowed to stay away from options. 

Then in October I invested $10,000CAD in cryptocurrency, and lost $3000.

Then the December boom came and my portfolio turned into $30000. I borrowed an additional $40,000 to take advantage of the massive pump, but by the time the funds came in I felt I missed out. So I put money into VEN, then sold for a 5% loss when it didn't move up fast enough, and put into TRON, etc. I kept chasing pumps until I was down to my last $16,000. 

I was furious because soon after I sell, the coin would 3x or 4x. Still, I managed to reach $85,000 CAD thanks to the mania. This coin proceeded to decline in value and I could not sell because I changed 2FA login settings and was locked out for 2 weeks. 

Then January came. All currencies started dropping, except VEN. I was tilted because if I stayed in VEN I would have ended up with $300,000. 

I made some riskier plays until I was down to $20,000. This was also because of the bear market. I was so sure that bitcoin would drop to $3000 that I shorted bitcoin with 10x leverage. 

Bitcoin proceed to bounce from $5900 back to $9000.

I basically lost all my money trying to regain enough to pay back my loans by gambling even more. 

I've spent the past 2 months dreaming about being a millionaire, while neglecting school and relationships. I feel I have no way out of this mess I created.

7wqi2r,1518320407,aapl,Question about IV.,"So as I understand it, IV is probably the biggest (?) factor in determining the premium of a short-term option, but one thing I don’t fully understand is just *how* impactful it can it be in a very short window of time. 

On Friday, I was looking at buying AAPL March 23 $155 calls when the DOW was down about 1.55% because I was thinking we were near the low of the day.  I picked some up for 6.80 a contract.

Then the Dow went for a really quick dip to -2.25% ish and I was able to double down at 6.00 for the same contracts.
(Sorry if referencing the DOW is confusing - the stocks were very synced up and moving in unison).

I felt pretty good about my purchase a few minutes later when the markets started to recover but I noticed something that I’m not entirely sure how to explain.

As AAPL’s share price recovered past the share price I purchased the calls at on the way down, the options were trading about 5-10% cheaper on the open market.

Is this just a demonstration of an inefficient market given how quickly things were moving? 

Or is IV that much higher in a down trend but gets reduced quickly when the share price reverses, thereby hurting premium values? 

If the latter is true, is it cheaper to  buy calls on the way up vs the way down assuming you entered at the same share price in relation to the strike?  (I.e - buying 155 calls when the share price is 151 in a downtrend vs buying at 151 when it’s on a steady climb)

7wr3as,1518327850,mcd,Why is this app so buggy tonight?,"So, it's a crappy, snowy, hazardous night for driving in WNY.  Perfect for making some money with Eats.  I go to a restaurant and hit the green button.  I get a message that says, ""go to the counter and show the order number"".  No problema.  I show the order number and get the food.  I had never seen that screen before and it will not let me go any further to start the trip.  After trying numerous times, I call the restaurant.  I ask the girl to check her tablet and she says they never requested a driver.  I wait several minutes and try again.  Still no luck.  I eventually cancel the trip and press ""other"" with an explanation and go on my way to the next one.  I noticed that when I start my next few trips that it is stuck in routing.  No biggie because I have literally memorized all of the streets in my area (12 years medical transporting and around 45,000 trips).  The driving is slow and I double parked a few times because I am worried about getting stuck.  I'm thinking that it is time to call it a night but figured I could do one more while the promotion was still going.  My last ping and it is the McD's near my house.  I pull up and hit the green button.  ""go to the counter and blah blah blah""  Great, it is happening again.  I explain to the manager that there might be a problem, but he says everything is cool on his end.  Try as I might, the app will not let me start the trip.  Again I cancel and press ""other"" with an explanation.  Go home and eat McDonalds for the first time in a year.  Junior Big Mac, large fries, 2 hot fudge sundays with extra fudge and a large DIET COKE (lol).  The pork dish from the Asian Fusian restaurant will be eaten for lunch tomorrow.  It really upsets me that I could not make those deliveries because I lost money and I do go out of my way to make sure people get their food.  I checked the app when I got home and now my satisfaction rating is 98% with a 20% cancellation.  Is this a carry over from the network error the other day?  ",0

7wrknx,1518335096,msft,"New weekly stock analysis, and contest!","Hey everyone!

Some of you might remember me as the guy who used to do [these threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/5pbsvu/weekly_charting_ill_analyze_the_top_10_stock/) where we took the top ten tickers posted and analyzed the charts each week. The discussions were always awesome and we had a lot of fun analyzing stuff!

This year I want to take those technical analysis videos a step further and introduce a new idea for helping the /r/stockmarket community grow, helping everyone (including me!) learn more about the markets, and helping bring attention to a freaking [awesome new website](https://www.lazyfa.com) I've spent the last couple of years building and that I'm super proud of.

--------------------------

**Beginning this coming Friday, Feb 16th, I'll be starting an awesome new weekly video series** in which I'll pick a stock that's been hot and in play for the week and do a brief personal analysis on it. I'll create a short video announcing the ticker we're going to be analyzing that week and giving everyone my quick introductory overview/opinion of the fundamentals of the company (which may be right or wrong) and a quick look at the chart and my thoughts there. Then I'm going to open up the entire site free of charge to anyone who wants to analyze the stock themselves so that they can dig in! The ticker we're working on will be completely free to analyze from when I post the video on Friday evening until the following Friday when it changes to a new ticker.

-------------------------------

Now here's the fun part: Because everyone is going to be digging in and analyzing the company, I figure why not drum up a little friendly competition? So each week, once the video is posted **everyone is welcome and encouraged to post their own analysis of the company and each week on Sunday at 8pm ET I will start reviewing all the analysis that's been posted, all the discussion in the thread and everything we've drummed up about the company.** What I'm going to do is pick a ""winner"" each week - the person who's provided the most thorough, most interesting or most useful analysis of the company - and hook them up with a free month of access to the whole site where I've got over 20 years of fundamental company data on almost 10,000 stocks. 

-------------------------------

I'm hoping this will stir up some awesome discussion on in-play tickers in this sub, and maybe even produce some surprising longer term trading/investment ideas that could make everyone some money!

If you want to check out the site I'll be using to do most of the analysis before I start the videos this Friday, you can create a free account at https://www.lazyfa.com and use any of the free tickers (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL etc) to give everything a thorough test drive.

-------------------------------

**TL;DR** Starting this Friday I'll be posting a quick video analyzing an in-play stock from that week. I'll post the video Friday evening, and you'll have til Sunday night at 8PM ET to post your own analysis of the company. Whoever posts the best analysis gets free stuff.

7wts4r,1518367168,mcd,[Rant] Friends gossiping in front of me because I like trans women,"I had a very bad moment yesterday. I met friends and we went to a bar, sat down at a table. We were talking about Tinder and a guy asked 'You had that story where you almost dated a girl but then it turned out to be trans?' (I never said that). It was totally okay, and I replied I dont remember, but straight after that, a girl instantly whispered to him. Not even whispered as this was a small table, basically she was talking to him in a way so that others can not hear it. Then he was talking to another guy. It was very weird and cringy, everyone got quiet, I was like ""guys, what the fuck is happening?"" and the cringe continouned.

It got me very mad, but I stayed calm. I did have a trans woman who was my girlfriend for long and our relationship was public. Im not ashamed but I do not want to disclose my orientation in public, with others that do not know about it. After that a girl and a guy who were my very close friends went to a McD's. The girl knew and the guy told me he knew it too and its okay. I was very glad that they were normal about it.

However, the girl who gossiped was the last straw. For a long time I was struggling with people who acted in an outright disrespectful way around me, and this was non-excusable.

Again, Im lucky to say that I was never ever bullied for liking trans women as everyone who knows this was accepting towards me, so I dont want to make a big deal out of it, it just sucks to have people around you who does not care about what is precious to people.",0

7wvriv,1518384812,mcd,My dad used to do some nasty shit.,"He thought farting was so fucking funny. He would push so hard to get a fart out that sometimes he would literally shit himself. He always thought it was the funniest thing in the world, but it always put me on the edge of puking. The worst time was when I was in 6th grade. 

I had come back from a camping trip with my 6th grade class. I was exhausted and I hadn't eaten enough the previous week. My parents took me to McDonald's and I ordered the super sized Big Mac meal. My mouth was watering in anticipation for the feast I was about to have.

Then, the fucker did it. I almost cried. Just as I was about to dig in to my feast of Mickey Dees he lifts his leg next to me and lets out a nasty, wet fart that quickly turned into diarrhea shit. He is cackling like a banshee next to me with his pants filled with shit.

""Aww man I did it again!"" He blurts out in between howling laughter. At this point, we are a spectacle of the entire restaurant. My sadness turned into rage as I realize my McD's feast has been spoiled by a rotten, sour shit smell coming from my father next to me. 

My mother quickly shuffled me out of the restaurant while giving my now embarrassed father a dirty look. I dont know how he cleaned himself up or how he got home, but me and my mother left him there and he came home hours later. He was forced to spend the night on the couch.",0

A mate from this subreddit suggested it'd be nice to share which apps I find useful to play, so I figured I might as well create a new post so we can all share them.  I'm going to talk about Android apps, as I bought a cheap Amazon Fire HD 8 to serve as support for my games. Anyway, this is the list of the apps I have installed on it to help me:

#Random Generators
* [Custom Image Dice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.boardnaut.studios.customimagedice&amp;hl=es): this is the app I value the most. It lets you create card decks based on any image set, so I can use scans of cards or just decks I bought to add random generators for whatever I want. Seriously, it takes some time to get decks into it, but you can create whatever you want with it. I love it.
* [Adventuresmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.steavesea.adventuresmith&amp;hl=es): a collection of a huge number of random generators for every genre. Seriously, it has almost everything. Use it.
* [DM Screen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awedsoftware.dungeonsanddragonsrandomtables&amp;hl=es): a collection of the random tables generated on another subreddit, /r/behindthetable. It is centered on fantasy generators.
* [RPG Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mpvreeken.rpgcompanion&amp;hl=es): more generators. This one is still growing and it's easy and fun to use.
* [Assistant For Mythic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.glezmen.mythicassistant&amp;hl=es): a barebones implementation of the standard GME rules. Pretty useful, though I play using my scripts on Editorial on iOS.

# Game dependent apps

## Dnd 5e

* [Monsters for D&amp;D 5e](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saladdragonapps.monstersfordnd5e&amp;hl=es): a bestiary. Incomplete due to licensing.
* [Complete Reference for DnD 5e](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vansteinengroentjes.apps.ddfive&amp;hl=es): a very nice app with almost everything published. It allows users to create new content. It has a character manager and DM tools behind a paywall.

* [The Grand Grimoire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.cordova.GrandGrimoire&amp;hl=es): spell lists for days.

## Pathfinder

* [Complete Reference for Pathfinder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vansteinengroentjes.apps.ddpf&amp;hl=es): same concept as the one for Dnd 5e. Very useful.

* [Pathfinder Monsters OGL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blank.bestiary&amp;hl=es): a bestiary for pathfinder.

## Fate

* [Deck of Fate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hiddenachievement.DeckOfFate&amp;hl=es): an app implementation of the deck of fate. Nice to simulate dice rolls or get random skills.
* [Fate Sheets](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=link.standen.michael.fatesheets&amp;hl=es): a nice app to keep your character sheet.

## FFG Star Wars

* [Adversaries](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saladdragon.adversaries&amp;hl=es): a collection of lots of enemies for the game. It also has filters for the game, faction and enemy level.
* [Holocron](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.raincitygamers.holocron&amp;hl=es): a character sheet app.

## Random

* [Serif](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=clear.serif&amp;hl=es): this one's quite gimmicky. It allows you to define characters and create conversations between them. Maybe it's your cup of tea. I haven't tested it extensively, but give it a look.

* [Anima Magic Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.enlight.anima.animamagiccards&amp;hl=es): a grimoire for the Anima RPG spells. I use it mainly for flavour, as it has lots and lots of spells for lots of categories and schools. It may give you some ideas for cool powers.

Those are some of the ones I use semi-frequently. I hope you find them useful and, please, share the ones you use!

7wy9bz,1518409457,mcd,Update: The Black Pantser actually contacts youngest DD. DD2 isnt impressed and very uncomfortable at the conversation,"Talked with DD2 tonight on the phone/Facetime tonight over many things and showing off her dog and showing off my dogs. Our usual phone conversations.

Almost an hour into our conversation DD says ""Mommy I didn't want to tell you in case you got mad but Grandma/The Black Pantser did call me a few weeks ago. I picked up the call by accident w/o looking at who it was. Sorry. But yes it was grandma. So I ended up talking to her.""

Grandma told her that she hasn't talked to me(F&amp;FM) in ages and did she (DD2) know if I was mad at her and if she knew what she(MIL) did. DD2 played dumb and said she didn't know anything.  

Now you are expecting MIL to recruit DD2 to be a FM but she didn't as far as what DD was saying. But a few things she said to DD2 the passive aggressive guilt was at a level 10.  Grandma asked if DD2 was married yet to that boy(apparently being 31 is a boy) she was seeing the last time DD2 was seeing when Gma saw her a year ago. DD2 said ""Of course not."" But DD2 said to me ""Frankly I probably wouldn't tell her or the rest of that family the way they treat us."" Grandma said that it wouldn't surprise her if she didnt know if DD2 got married. Not sure if this was a jib at me or at DD2.

DD2 said she felt very uncomfortable throughout the whole conversation. 

Now DD2 did ask if I was ever going to talk to Grandma and I said most likely not. But if she wanted to that was fine and understood if she wanted to and I had no problem with it. As long as it is not me, I dont care.

She asked what was the big thing that Grandma did that made me go completely NC.

I had to remind her of Grandmas actions at the funeral, her actions of moving across the country when her son was dying of an incurable disease instead of being near him(she did not have to move mind you), her passive aggressiveness in general. The final straw of her favoritism of the grandchild where my kids received dirty yard sale gifts and the golden grandchildren received $100 checks. 

DD2 did not remember Gma's actions at the funeral, as she was just turning 13 and dealing with her emotions, she didn't know that Gma moved across the country for her own selfish purposes(when she had a house that was paid for only 3 hours from us) and she doesn't remember the really screwed up Christmas gifts that were given when Grandma was going on cruises, re-doing both of her homes and then telling the kids to order off the 1.00 menu when they did visit her (DD2 stood her ground and said NO, at McD's and demanded an adult meal and got it grudgingly from Gma), having the kids clean her house when they visited her instead of taking them out for educational trips/outings that were promised when they were flown out. [Sorry this is my worst written paragraph, she makes my mind go cuckoo!]

This was a hard phone call that I didn't think I would be having when it started.  But DD2 and I are still thick as thieves and we ended the call discussing the color of her manicure color.

7wzymw,1518432669,mcd,"The B** got what she deserved, right in the kisser.","TL;DR at the bottom. LTL, FTP. Throwaway too.

While back, maybe a decade ago, I was heading home but saw train being delayed for extra 25 minutes, so I decided to stop by for some delicious McD's, mainly to avoid the task of cooking at home.

I queue for a moment to left side register and place my order for a standard meal, no extras or stuff. Guy next to me orders like 20 burgers and bucketful of nuggets and what not, but no drinks, as take-away. I get my meal in like 30 seconds and sit down to closest table. Guy that was ordering next to me comes and asks if he could sit down at my table, while waiting for his take-away, for which I just nod and move my tray to the side a bit, leaving space for him to put his helmet and gloves and a towel. It's 4-seat table anyways, so plenty of space. He was wearing this baseball uniform, red pants and yellow/red striped top. It was quite exotic overall, as the baseball is not something that is that common sport around here (not in US). I don't think much of it, only that he must be a coach for some kids team, and just keep munching away my meal, while Mr Baseball focuses on his phone.

After a minute, a WB (Whiny Bitch) appears in all her pink clothes and tells to my new friend about something being wrong at her order. Mr Baseball just glances a bit upwards, not even close to eye level and states: ""Registers are over there, go there to complain, I don't work here.""

The WB just stares Mr Baseball a bit and then proceeds to dump two sundaes on his lap, asking with increasing volume: ""Well do you work here now!?"" and proceeds to slap his phone on the floor and starts to stomp it while cursing him out.

Mr Baseball gets up and pushes her off from his phone, and she takes few steps back. He picks up the phone and sits back down in disbelief with the mess in his lap. After like a good 10 seconds, she theatrically falls on the ground shouting that employee pushed him down and banged her head on the trash bin. (Luckily, the phone was OK with no damage: Nokia phone, 10+ years ago). 

Then I point out for her: ""There is nothing where you could hit you head in range. Besides, you attacked him, a fellow customer. He doesn't work here obviously, just look at what he has with him."" She stops whining for 2 seconds and crawls towards the dumpster and then increases the volume of her whining.

Commotion attracts a manager and one of the cashiers to see what's going on. WBs volume just increases and now her chest hurts too. She then realizes that she was pushed from her chest and now her accusations escalates *a bit*, she claims that she was sexually abused and raped in daylight in middle of McD's floor.

As a stroke of luck (or destined by Karma), a pair of policemen arrives. Maybe they were patrolling the train station and someone just pulled them in, or maybe they were also grabbing a snack, or a coffee or a drink. Manager gets them to help to sort out the situation and the accompanied cashier helps Mr Baseball to clean his uniform up (using my napkins I might add, so I was left with only 1 napkin that I had wrapped around my burger :/ !!)

One cop tries to calm the WB down, and she screams that her ankle is broken and pelvis shattered and she was raped. The policeman just says to her that she really shouldn't be rolling on the disgusting McD's floor, at the train station, around rush hour. That shuts her up and up she gets up from the floor. Suddenly ankle and pelvis are healed miraculously (probably she is related to a top italian soccer player?), but she still feels that she was sexually abused by McD worker and demands his job for pushing her over. She still doesn't get it; Mr Baseball doesn't work there (and he didn't push her over obviously).

Manager gets back with the other cop in a minute and the cop states that security footage shows clearly WB attacking Mr Baseball and attempting to destroy his property, which he was entitled to defend, especially as that didn't cause any harm for her. WB starts to scream, but the cop calmly interrupts her by stating that there was 10 seconds between the push and her falling over, while she clearly hadn't lost balance due to the push and that she is clearly faking the entire episode.

WB slaps the cop and screams something non-audible, that I can't understand. Other cop instantly twists her arm behind her back and cuffs her. She keeps just whining and whining and whining and fighting the cops, trying to get free. 

Most of the people in the restaurant are leaving, but hey, it's a dinner *and a show* so I'm not going yet but finish my fries instead. Cops tells that she is being arrested and asks if Mr Baseball wants to make a report out of it. He just says that his phone is OK and clothes needs wash anyways, so he just wants to leave. Cops are OK with that and so is the manager.


**Justice is served, as the WB got arrested? Did she get what she ordered? Absolutely. That is great, yes. But let's finish the story about her dessert.**


At this point, Mr Baseball gets called to the registers, his order is ready. He gets 3 bags of food and starts to leave. He walks back to my table and puts on his gloves (not a field-glove, but kind of ones keeping your hands warm, maybe batter gloves?) and helmet and stuffs the towel under his belt. As he turns to leave, she kicks him into his shin/foot and spits towards his face. I heard this plastic *pop*, so he must have worn some sort of guards. For a split second, I think she got away from it, but Mr Baseball ""falls down"" towards her (read: headbutt her with all his strength, even carpet crumpled a bit), wearing his helmet. **Pow! R-I-G-H-T in the kisser.** Even as two cops are holding her, she falls down and is spitting out her teeth on the floor and a puddle of blood.

He just says with totally different, kinda with this fuck-head-bitch-tone: ""Oh damn my leg, MY LEG, I nearly fell because you kicked me, stupid. Oh, oh, I hope you are alright. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I hope you are alright?"". Cops just tells Mr Baseball to leave, which he does.

One cop radios some codes and starts to pick her up, while the slapped cop is picking some loose teeth into a discarded BicMac box (with some cheese and lettuce remains in it). There are at least 5 items that the cop picks up from the floor, maybe more, but those could be onion pieces or that coarse street salt they use at winter time. After the cops gets the WB up, she spits at the cop carrying the teeth, blaming them for everything, to which the cop just says: ""Alright then, so be it."" and drops the box on the floor while maintaining an eye contact with her. She looks like she will start her shouting again, so the cops drags her outside while twisting her arms further, making her bend, forcing her face downwards and away from them.

Manager just looks at me like this wouldn't be the first time something like this happens and asks if everything is OK with me offering a dessert for my troubles. I just thank him for the show and leave as it's like 2 minutes for my train while expressing my sympathy for the McD workers.

Outside, I see few more equally pink WB's friends harassing the policemen, whom gets threatened to be arrested too, if they enter the restaurant, as they would go there just to be belligerent and to make a scene. 

Show was over and my train arrives. Didn't even have time for after dinner smoke, but that entire episode was worth of watching. But it was quite difficult to walk over to the train with my huge, raging justice boner. I didn't even jack-off for a week, just to preserve the boner.


TL;DR: Whiny Bitch loses some teeth and gets arrested for attacking a fellow customer and probably gets jailed too, for attacking police officers.

7x0e53,1518438457,nvda,My Online Dating/Catfish Story,"Before I get into the story, I want to give a little bit of background. I’m a 30-year-old female living in the southwestern United States. At the time this incident took place, I was 26 years old. This took place in September of 2014. At the time, I was very lonely, and vulnerable. My boyfriend of nearly 6 years, broke up with me at the end of January of that year, and I had been single for almost 8 months. I was also confused about my sexuality. I wasn’t sure whether to identify as lesbian or bisexual. Now I know for sure that I’m bisexual, but at the time, I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that I really wanted to try things with a woman. Up until that point, I only dated guys. There were a couple of times I came close, but the woman in question wasn’t interested, so I was single, alone, and really felt I had no where to turn but online. Another piece of background before I get into the story, I am blind. I was born with a condition where the optic nerve didn’t develop properly, which resulted in my blindness. I read braille, and I also use assistive technology to help me adapt. I use a screen reader, which is a program that takes the text on the screen, and translates it into spoken word. There are several screen readers on the market. Now, I currently use Voice Over, which was developed by apple. It’s available on mac, and all IOS devices. At the time, I didn’t have an iPhone, however, so I used a free screen reader called NVDA, which is for windows. I use screen readers to send email, browse the net, play games, etc. There is a program developed by someone in the United Kingdom, called RS Games. It is a gaming console specifically for the blind, and has a lot of different games to choose from. It’s cross platform, meaning it’s available on windows, mac, IOS, and they also have a web client. You can also chat, and send instant messages to people. Now with the background information out of the way, let’s get to the story. 

     This was the beginning of September of 2014. I logged onto RS games one night to play their newest game at the time, cards against humanity. The game needed at least 3 players, so I found an open table, and joined. One of the players at the time was going by the username CuddlyKitten. She sent me an IM, and introduced herself to me as Ashley. She told me she was 36, lesbian, and pregnant with twins. I told her my name, my age, and that I’m bisexual, which is what I said at the time, even though I was still confused. She told me that the twins she was carrying were actually her brother’s. She was a surrogate mother for him and his wife, since she couldn’t have any more children. I thought that was so sweet of her to help her brother like that, and found the story very inspirational. Especially more so after she told me another part of her history. She proceeded to tell me that she was raped in college, and that she gave birth to a daughter as a result of the rape, but had to give her up for adoption. I felt horrible for her, and proud of her at the same time. She had been through a lot, and yet, she was willing to help her brother. I truly admired her bravery, and found myself falling for her. I asked her if she had skype, and she said no. I happened to have some skype credit at the time, so I asked if she had a phone so I could call her. She told me that she had a phone, but she couldn’t talk on it unless it was an emergency. She explained to me that she owed her parents a lot of money for talking on sex chat lines, and that her parents said the phone could only be used for emergencies. I told her they wouldn’t know the difference, because she lives in her own house, and I could call her, but she didn’t want to take the risk. I should have seen the red flag, but I felt I finally met someone special, so   I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. She did give me her email address, so we would email back and forth. At the time, I had an Olympus digital voice recorder, and I decided only 4 days after talking to her, that I wanted to give things a shot. Very poor judgement on my part, I know, but I hated being single, and I wanted so much to have a woman to call my own. I felt like she was someone I could look up to, and that I could trust her. And so I asked her out in the recording, and, as embarrassing as it is to admit this, the recording turned sexual. It was the first sexually explicet recording I sent her. Instead of doing nude pictures, like the sighted world, we blindies usually make recordings for one another. I trusted this woman implicetly, and was so drawn to her, that I thought there wasn’t any reason things could go wrong. The next morning, I’ll never forget. It was September 7, 2014, which happened to fall on a Sunday. I logged back onto RS games, and I got an IM from Ashley. She told me she wanted to tell me something special. She accepted my proposal to be girlfriends, and she thought my recording was hot. I was a lot happier than I had been in months. No longer was I single. My dream of having a girlfriend had finally come to fruition, and I couldn’t be happier. I was absolutely over the moon. That day, she introduced me to all of her friends. She usually played farkle with a group of friends every day, and I was welcomed warmly into the group. I lost touch with all of them though. Anyway, I was so excited at the prospect of having a new girlfriend, and I continued making her recordings, and sending her instant messages. It was paradise for me. I felt like I had finally found someone who truly loved me, and wasn’t just dating me out of pity like my last boyfriend.

     However, not to far into the relationship, I noticed some discrepancies. We played truth or dare one night, and I asked her who was her first girlfriend. She told me it was a woman named Kate. But then, a few months later, she told me that her first ever girlfriend came to visit her, and her name was Crystal. That’s odd, I thought her name was Kate, I thought to myself. Then she told me that Lucy was her niece who had CP, then when I was talking about it, she corrected me and said it was Lacey who had CP. I was puzzled, but I shrugged it off. It’s very possible I could have misunderstood, and I didn’t want to lose my girlfriend over something so small, so I shoved it to the back of my mind, and forgot about it. A few days later, Ashley told me she was going to be making a speech at an awards ceremony. I asked her if there would be footage of the event, and she said yes. I told her I wanted a copy so I could hear what she sounded like. But after the ceremony, she gave me the run around, saying she was having trouble getting the tape. Again, this should have been another red flag, but again, I shrugged it off.

     Fast forward to Christmas day of 2014. I saw Ashley’s account signed in, so I sent her a message. I got a message back a few minutes later saying, is this Angela? I was surprised, and said it was me. The message was supposedly from Ashley’s brother. She was in labor, so he was on RS games, updating everyone. I found that odd, considering that the screen in the RS games program was all white, and you couldn’t see anything. The only way you could read messages was to play on the website, but he said he was listening to the screen reader, and Ashley showed him how to send messages. Another thing I found odd is that he wasn’t with Ashley while she was giving birth. And why wouldn’t Ashley just log on when she was back from the hospital and update all of us? I finally realized there were too many inconsistancies to ignore. Even my sister said it sounded odd, but now I was starting to wonder if she was right. I think Ashley realized I was on to her, and that’s why she abruptly broke up with me after delivery. She wasn’t that nice about it either. I was fuming, and posted on twitter that I hope she and her twins would rot in hell. I regret posting that, but all the same, things just didn’t seem right.

     Now fast forward to August of 2015. I was, and still am the kind of person who hates ending things on a sour note. I always try to fix things, and end on good terms, and at the very least, be cordial. So I messaged Ashley on RS games, and tried to work out the wrongs that happened 8 months before. Then, I got a message from a guy who I thought was a friend, called Jeremy. It said something along the lines of, Hey Angela, were you and Ashley together? I was puzzled, because I met him after the break up with Ashley, so he never knew about her. I said yes, and asked him why. He proceeded to drop the biggest bomb shell in history. He told me that Ashley was not who she said she was. He said that she was actually a he. Yup, you heard me right, Ashley is a guy. I was absolutely horrified. And then it hit me, every single story she told me was a lie. She was never raped, she was never pregnant, and all of those nieces and nephews she had, didn’t exist. Everything that came out of her mouth was a lie. And the most embarrassing part about it was that every single recording I made, was actually going to some pervert. I was scared, embarrassed, and angry at the same time. I thanked Jeremy for telling me. Earlier, I said I thought he was my friend. Well, I soon realized that he was acting shady after telling me about Ashley. He admitted he had 12 accounts on the server, and even said he pretended to be a female in 2014. The same year that I met Ashley. I have no way to prove it, but I believe that Jeremy and Ashley are one in the same. So, the moral of the story is, don’t date someone online until you hear their voice, and spend time getting to know them. And if something sounds even a little fishy, or too good to be true, don’t ignore it, because it probably is.",1

7x4avw,1518471815,aapl,End of day Summary - 02/12,"The Dow rose 410.37, or 1.7%, to 24,601.27, the Nasdaq gained 107.47, or 1.56%, to 6,981.96, and the S&amp;P 500 advanced 36.45, or 1.39%, to 2,656.00.

---

Equities quietly reclaimed a nice chunk of last week's losses on Monday, with the Dow climbing 1.7%, the Nasdaq rising 1.6%, and the S&amp;P 500 adding 1.4%. Stocks opened sharply higher then, following a slight pullback in the opening hour of trading, tacked on gains throughout the session. 

There was some of last week's volatility at the opening bell, but stocks spent the majority of the day in a steady ascension. A modest sell off in the late afternoon left the major stock indices a step below their session highs. At its best mark of the day, the S&amp;P 500 was up 2.0%.

Each of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors advanced on Monday, with 8 adding at least 1.0%. The materials (+2.1%) and technology (+1.8%) sectors were the strongest groups, while the telecom services (+0.8%), utilities (+0.8%), and real estate (+0.3%) sectors were the weakest. **Within the tech space, AAPL showed particular strength, jumping 4.0%**, and CSRA spiked 31.1% after agreeing to be acquired by GD for approximately $9.6 billion, or $40.75 per share, in cash--which is a 32.2% premium over Friday's closing price.

The energy sector (+1.7%) led for much of the day, but weakened in the afternoon as the price of crude oil came down from its session high. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up around 2.5% at their best mark of the day, but finished higher by just 0.2% at $59.30 per barrel. Still, the modest gain broke a six-session losing streak for the commodity.

Among **the notable gainers was penny-stock SRTI surged 82% higher after the company announced that it was changing its name to SRTI Blockchain Generation**, ""reflecting the company's newfound commitment to becoming a player in the evolution of blockchain technology.

 Among the noteworthy losers was LL, which dropped 9% after Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded the stock to Neutral from Outperform. Also lower was ULTA, which slid 4% following a report that the company is being sued and accused by a shopper of repackaging returned, used products and putting them back on shelves.

Europe joined in the upbeat mood, with stocks rising across the region. Stocks also bounced back in Asia, with China’s Shenzhen Composite, which tracks smaller-cap stocks, climbing 2.7%.

# Currency

The dollar fell against the euro on Monday following its best week against the single currency in nearly 15 months, as U.S. stocks recovered a bit from the dramatic selloff that saw the S&amp;P 500's sharpest decline in more than two years. **The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.3% at 90.19.**

- EUR/USD: +0.26% to 1.2282
- GBP/USD: +0.05% to 1.3827
- USD/CAD: +0.18% to 1.2601

# Treasury

In the bond market, U.S. Treasuries were under pressure on Monday, pushing yields higher across the curve. **The yield on the benchmark 10-yr Treasury note climbed three basis points to 2.86%, closing at a fresh four-year high**, while the 2-yr yield ticked up one basis point to 2.07%.


- 2-yr: +1 bp to 2.07%
- 5-yr: +4 bps to 2.56%
- 10-yr: +3 bps to 2.86%
- 30-yr: UNCH at 3.14%

# Commodity

Oil prices ended Monday's session little changed after earlier rebounding strongly from last week's steep losses as global equities steadied following their largest one-week slide in two years.

- Mar WTI Crude is up 0.17% on the day. Futures settle $0.10 higher to $59.30/barrel. In other energy, Mar Natural Gas settled down $0.03 at $2.55/MMBtu

7xa37s,1518535386,gme,My GM Journal setup and how to make your own.,"/u/Classictoy requested that I post my setup for my Game-Mastering Journal. Unfortunately, I can't get my phone camera to take decent photos, so I'll just write up what it looks like (in a tutorial?) until I can borrow someone's camera and update this post. Also, it's 1am as I type this and I'm a little drowsy, so if this post is a little all-over-the-place, don't say I didn't warn you. 

***

**Step 1:** *Find or make a notebook you'll enjoy using. Bonus: get a pen you really like, it makes a difference!*

So, using [this coptic stitch binding tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue52htX3j0k), I stitched up a journal with 16 signatures (if you watch the tutorial, you'll know what a signature is). I just used black stiffened felt for the covers, cheap copy paper for the insides, and yellow cotton thread for the stitching. I use a Pilot Prera fountain pen for writing - so satisfying!

**Step 2:** *Number each page.*

To save time, I just number the odd pages. I have a total of 255. 

**Step 3:** *Decide what categories you want in your journal and divide the journal accordingly.*

This is based off of The Vault idea from [StrikeThru](https://youtu.be/b-Zukikrw_Q), which is a lot more efficient than Bullet Journal in my experience. I'll explain how this works after I list the categories I decided on. 

**My categories:**

* *Inspiration*: after watching Adam Koebel's video on [Barfology](https://youtu.be/0RWYrsmIux8?t=38m19s) (from [The Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAmPx8nWedFVGdrP2JmcYzdvZC8sWV5b4) series on YouTube - highly recommended!!), I decided I wanted to start writing down things from movies/books/games/etc. to inspire me in my games. 

	* e.g. an interesting scene from Neon Genesis Evangelion (ep 15): *a boy sits on a suburban porch by a bicycle with a bag of groceries next to him, feeding a stray cat chips from a plastic bag. He looks ordinary, but is in fact an informant waiting for his drop.*

* *GM-ing*: this is where I write down rules for the different RPG systems I'm learning, notes from advice/tips I come across online and a to-do list specifically for GM-ing.

* *Prep*: this is where I store pages of pre-generated dice rolls, random name generators (male names, female names, town names, etc.) and where I write notes for prepping multi-player games. 

* *Actual Play*: where I write down notes of solo games (which I've shared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mythic_gme/comments/7w38xe/solo_warrior_cat_game_loosely_based_off_of_the/)).

I have four categories, so I've divided my journal up into even-sized quarters and put a marker at the start of each of these sections. I've also made a **Master Index** page at the start of the book where I've put down the categories and the page number they're in. 

The book doesn't have to be divided up evenly, if you think you'll use up more pages in one category and less in another, give one category more pages and another one less. I haven't done a GM Journal before this one, so I just kept them all the same size. 

You can use my categories if you like, or come up with your own for your needs. 

**Step 4:** *For each category/section, leave the first two pages blank for your Index Page. This is where you add your sub-categories and their page numbers.*

 I'm not sure how to explain it without giving an example, so here's what my index page looks like under **GM-ing**. (If the numbers are all over the place, it's because I didn't organise my journal until later, so some of the pages are mixed at the front of the book). 

&gt;GM-ing
&gt;=========

&gt;Rules
&gt;-------
&gt;- Fate Adversary Toolkit - p.54
&gt;- Mythic GME
	- 111 - Ch.1: Adventures
	- 113 - Ch 2: Fate Chart
	- etc. 

&gt;To-Do List
&gt;-------
- Systems to Learn - p.108
- Movies to watch - p.2, 36
- Organisation/Meta - p. 58 
- etc.

&gt;Advice and Tips
---------
- Office Hours - p. 29-35
- Polyhedral Crew - p. 56-57
- etc.

Not all of them have to have sub-categories, my Index page for **Inspiration** is literally just this:

&gt;Inspiration
=======

&gt;- Neon Genesis Evangelion p. 17, 55, 59
- Teen Wolf p. 42-52
- Misc. 53 
- etc. 

And you're good to go! Let me know if this was helpful at all, if you have any questions, etc. 

Like I said, once I get my hands on a decent camera, I'll post actual photos, so stay tuned.  

Thanks!

7xaifu,1518538907,tsla,"The Next Thing That Will ""Blindside"" Elon, Part Deux : Labor Pains","For reference, the first post in what turns out will now be a series can be found here : https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7b30o3/the_next_thing_that_will_blindside_elonthe_cost/.

So, for all the talk about robots making cars in a dark factory at the cutting edge of air resistance, the reality in Fremont today is that most of the work building a Tesla is done by people.   At last check, something around 6,000 humans that churn out finished Teslas from the plant.

What follows that is two very basic but very important principles :

1) that the ability to build cars is ultimately bottlenecked by having enough people to build them, and 

2) that the quality of those cars is directly affected by the skill level and motivation of the people doing the building.

While we watch Tesla struggle to get more than a thousand Model 3s a week out of the plant, both of the axioms above have faded from prominence, but they remain true and, in the case of Tesla, problematic.

Let's start by looking at Point #1.  The layman that doesn't put much thought forward probably assumes that there is an endless supply of unemployed people who can and will work at Tesla, and the company simply needs to put out a sign and wait.  In reality, the pool of available workers is limited by many factors.

First, Tesla pays their line workers [about 30% below the national average](http://prospect.org/article/charge-time-electric-car-workers-accuse-tesla-low-pay-and-intimidation).  Yes, the company points out they bolster that pay with stock options, but those don't fully vest for four years, and their value is subject to change with TSLA's volatile valuation.

Even if we consider, with stocks, that the pay is ""average"" - let's say $30/hr, the Tesla factory worker would not be able to afford to live anywhere near...well... Tesla.   At $62,000/yr pre-tax, and $43,000 take-home, a Tesla worker will bring home $3,640/month.  This is a comfortable wage for most of America, [but the average rent of a 2-bedroom apartment in Fremont is $2,640 per month](http://prospect.org/article/charge-time-electric-car-workers-accuse-tesla-low-pay-and-intimidation).  

Sure, the worker could live far enough away from the plant that they find rent that fits this budget - but when now faced with a 60+ minute commute just to be able to pay the rent, why stay at Tesla?  

Especially when considering Tesla's borderline-adversarial relationship with their labor force, as evidenced in both the case of and reaction to [firing hundreds of employees without notice](https://electrek.co/2017/10/24/ex-tesla-employees-union-protest/), providing [work conditions that border on unsafe](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk), and all around [treating workers like children, instead of adults trying to feed their families](https://electrek.co/2017/02/24/tesla-union-elon-musk-addresses-employees/).  

So, the pool they are pulling from requires that people be unemployed, willing to make a long commute, and ok with having a third of their compensation be speculative, all while being treated as disposable and simply filling time until the Dreadnaught is ready.  That pool might not be large enough to produce 500,000 vehicles per year.

Now for the second part - quality.   

For the same reasons detailed above, is it at all surprising that those same employees are perhaps not entirely energized to build the world's highest-quality vehicles?  It stands to some common sense that when you have workers who cannot afford the product they are making, their interest level in the task at hand wavers somewhat.  Further, when you see your linemates terminated abruptly, asked to push the boundaries of what is safe, or treated as ultimately disposable, how much pride do you invest in your work?  Yes, in an ideal world the quality of the work should not rely on those factors, and ironically that is one of the driving reasons for the automation that will ultimately render their jobs obsolete - but in the here and now you are still working with humans, who you *need these people to build your cars*, and treating them poorly is essentially guaranteeing they won't be terribly invested in your company or the product you're selling.

Even if the company manages to find available workers with the right mindset, what if they have no experience in manufacturing?  Like any other job, there's a learning curve, and the product produced during that learning curve is sub-par.  Can Tesla ramp Model 3 production without recalls or major quality issues with a workforce that had to double in size in under a year to produce the needed volumes?  A workforce pulled from a pool that has no prior assembly experience?

Finally, one does wonder if these workers understand the amount of leverage they currently have over Tesla.  Surely the company realizes this, as their active campaign to prevent unionization shows.  But, theoretically, what would happen if the workers went on strike?  It's unlikely, as the workers rightfully value their next paycheck over just about any legitimate reason to walk out, but how quickly would Tesla fall if their plant just...stopped?  

Could Tesla survive a prolonged period of zero production at Fremont?  For a company spending a great deal of their revenue just to service their debt, any interruption of that revenue stream could be catastrophic.  One would think they would bear that in mind when determining their policies and behavior towards their workforce.

7xaksf,1518539438,mcd,This was all by design,"Hey /r/suns,

Just wanted to provide some perspective in what seems like a really bad time. Sure it's not great to be the first to 40 losses or have the same amount of 40+ pt losses as the rest of the league combined. I think a lot will be fixed when McD is ready to try winning. Whether you like it or not, the guy is committed to getting top picks. The Sixers fans were feeling what we were feeling 2 seasons ago, but look at them now. That'll be us next season.
 

It starts from the top, the front office. After the Bledsoe fiasco, we were never going to try to win this season. Otherwise, we would have traded for a real PG (before 2/3 of the season is wrapped up). We had a choice, commit to tanking or strive for 10th-12th seed. As an older Suns fan, a lot of us hated the annual tread-milling of the Suns. We constantly were in the running for the 7th-9th seed. We were never going to win the chip, let alone a playoff series. Despite all that, we ended up with the 13th-15th picks and guys like Markieff Morris and Earl Clark. Moreover, we did not have any big FAs that wanted to sign with aging veterans or mediocre young players. 


We are committed to getting top end talent through the draft. After all the ""con-build"" years, I am totally for this. Sure, not all of the draft picks are going to be hits, but top 5 picks give you the best shot at getting an All-Star. I'm personally not too discouraged because the most important thing is trying to get ahold of 3 star players. We have Booker. Jackson is looking like a future star. Bender is turning it around himself.  Between Jackson/Bender/Chriss/Warren/Payton, I think its likely one will become our second core piece. This summer will be about grabbing a 3rd future star either through the draft, trade, or possibly FA. The top 5 pick is key here because we can draft a player with All-Star potential or use it in a trade. The top 5 pick is the most valuable asset whether we use it to draft a future stud or to trading for a current/upcoming star.
